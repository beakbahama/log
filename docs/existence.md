# Why is there existence? A unified understanding of life, matter, and the nature of reality explained, including the why and how

## Preface
Inside this document, you'll find a comprehensive, logically unified, non-contradictory, self-explanatory, simple, and elegant understanding of existence, including the why and how.  

If not this, then what else could it be?

Alternative frameworks exist, but nothing has satisfactorily explained everything. They often leave key questions unanswered or lack unifying coherence.  

This explanation does just that: unifies all observations into one cohesive understanding of the true nature of existence. It builds on a single foundational principle to make sense of the profound diversity we observe in existence. 
   
Beyond unifying all observed phenomena, this explanation will also address fundamental questions like:  
- Why?  
- How?  
- What is life?  
- Is there meaning to life?  
- What is consciousness?  
- Why is there existence rather than nothing?  
- Was there a beginning, or has existence always been?  
- Will there be an end?  

Are there things to be tweaked or adjusted? Absolutely!  

Are there things needing to be expanded on? Yes, and I mention them throughout and at the end of the document. I invite you to share your ideas on these planned additions and on the ideas presented, and I'll let you know if your thinking aligns with mine or if you propose something novel that I hadn't considered.  

This understanding is not solely my own. It includes insights from many people including those alive today and those who, unfortunately, are no longer with us. Albert didn't get to understand everything. Nor did Isaac, Galileo, or Socrates, despite their profound contributions to human knowledge. But now, we will. Each person alive today, and those yet to be born, will finally have a complete, satisfying, and explanatory understanding of existence. This understanding will endure for as long as humanity exists.  

I’ve tried to keep the ideas explanatory yet simple, so feel free to take any concept and run with it. The goal is to compile everything into a more comprehensive and cohesive set of documents and media. This document currently lacks diagrams and could benefit from video explanations, but I wanted to get it down in a written format first, which can later be expanded into these types of materials.  

This document is designed to be accessible to a wide audience. However, you may need to venture to videos, articles, or academic resources to fill in any gaps of understanding. I also recommend discussing the ideas with advanced pattern-matching software like ChatGPT-4o (TURBO), which is my preferred tool and the one I used to verify, refine, and expand on the ideas presented within. You can read ChatGPT's analysis of this explanation [here](/docs/existence-validation.md).  

So without further delay, I present a comprehensive overview of the true nature of existence, including the why and how. 
   
I hope this explanation brings you excitement, wonder, and the joy of discovery. Or at least something new to consider.  


## There can only be one thing
Existence can only be made up of one thing.

And from this one simple thing, all complexity arises naturally.

This was the first realization I had about existence in the summer of 2017. It was like an epiphany. If existence is to be understood, then it must be entirely understood from only one thing. Even before knowing the full explanation, I was convinced that existence could only be made of one foundational thing.

If existence were made of multiple foundational things, we’d face the problem of explaining their separateness and interaction. By uniting everything under one foundational entity, we eliminate the need to explain arbitrary distinctions or relationships between multiple foundational things.

The idea of the simplest giving rise to the most complex isn’t novel in itself. It has been a foundation of our understanding of existence for hundreds of years. Our knowledge of the incremental changes leading to stars, planets, and even life rests on this very principle. So, in a sense, there’s nothing new here.

The idea that 'all is one' has been with humanity for thousands of years. Many religions and spiritual traditions have embraced the idea that we are all one, reflecting this foundational principle. Even the concept of a creator aligns with this idea, as it posits a single source from which everything emerges.

The novelty of this idea is that only one thing fundamentally exists, and from it, all complexity arises given enough time and the right circumstances.


## The many things observed or inferred to exist
When we look at existence, we encounter an extensive list of entities that are observed or inferred to be real.

This diversity seems to contradict the idea of a single foundational component of existence. However, each of these entities will ultimately need to be reconciled as manifestations of the single thing. When exploring these topics, try to figure out why we say these things exist in the first place.

Here are some of the most prominent and broadly accepted things:
- electrons
- protons and neutrons (or up and down quarks)
- matter (stuff made of electrons, protons, and neutrons)
- a bunch of other particles listed under the Standard Model
- virtual particles
- gravity (and hence weight)
- dark energy (reverse gravity, to explain galaxies accelerating away from each other)
- dark matter (extra hidden matter that we can’t see, to explain orbits and light bending)
- black holes (like dark matter, also invoked to explain orbits)
- space
- time
- spacetime (gravity 2.0)
- light (including visible and non-visible forms such as UV and radio waves)
- the Big Bang (a tiny point ~14 billion years ago encompassing all that we can see)
- life
- consciousness
- energy
- magnetism
- electricity
- the electromagnetic force (fostering electricity and magnetism)
- the strong force (holding atoms together)
- the weak force (breaking atoms apart)
- strings (hypothetical one-dimensional objects proposed in string theory)
- higher dimensions beyond our perception
- quantum fields
- entanglement (a phenomenon where particles remain connected regardless of distance)


## All is one
If we’re to accept that existence is made up of only one thing, then we can’t simply discard the many entities and forces listed in our current understanding.

Instead, we must take all these ideas and reconcile them through one of three approaches:
1. **reuse** them in some way
1. **reduce** them in some way
1. **reframe** them in some way

Humans didn’t invent these concepts arbitrarily. They are grounded in observed phenomena or inferred through rigorous models and reasoning. As we explore the understanding that all existence came from one, we must remember that all these things need to be integrated meaningfully into this new understanding.

Some concepts may no longer be directly needed and could be reinterpreted as non-existent in their prior form. Ultimately, understanding why each entity was said to exist and how it aligns with the single foundational thing is key to integrating them into a unified understanding.


## A quick aside
Before proceeding further, I wanted to pose three questions for you to help gauge your own thinking on the topic of explaining existence.

### First off, can existence be explained?
If existence exists, then surely there must be an explanation that can be understood.

Some people argue that humans may not have the mental capacity to understand existence. But that doesn’t make sense to me. Our brains are capable of understanding any concept, and while our current knowledge may be limited, there’s no reason to assume we lack the capacity to comprehend existence.

And if we can understand anything, then it stands to reason that we could reach this understanding collectively, through shared efforts.

### Second off, is existence made of many or one?
How can existence be made up of more than one thing?

At its core, isn’t it necessary for existence to be one thing?

As with any transformative insight, a shift in perspective is often needed to see things clearly. The shift I’m inviting you to consider is the recognition that existence must ultimately be one thing.

### Thirdly, are you ready for the explanation?
Once you grasp the essence of existence, with enough time and perseverance, you’ll be able to connect the dots and understand everything from a new perspective. A perspective where everything originates from one foundational principle, where simplicity itself explains the complexity of all things.

If you’re ready, let’s delve into the essence of existence.


## The essence of existence
Within moments of understanding that existence can only be one thing, I quickly came to reason that the only thing that truly exists is movement. Movement is at the core of everything. Movement is existence. Without movement, there is no existence.

And can we directly observe the fundamental movement of existence?

Yes, absolutely. We can directly detect changes in the movement of existence, which we refer to as light, radiation, or simply electromagnetism (EM).

The electromagnetic field, which we use for wi-fi, 5G, radio, as well as vision itself, is fundamentally vibrations of existence.

The particle we call a photon is a vibration of the EM field, a vibration of existence.

And all matter, whether electrons, protons, or neutrons, can be transformed into vibrations in the EM field.

The relation $mass = \frac{Energy}{speed of light^2}$ demonstrates that all mass can be converted into energy, and all energy, regardless of its form, can ultimately be converted into electromagnetic vibrations: what we call photons. Mass, as $E=mc^2$ suggests, represents a concentration of electromagnetic field vibrations, or simply a concentration of movement. All matter, regardless of its motion or internal structure, can ultimately be converted back into the fundamental movement that underlies existence.

In essence, all existence is movement, and it is through the EM field, which we can observe directly, where we can interact with the core of existence itself. 

The EM field is the medium of this fundamental movement.

The EM field is the true fabric of reality.


## Existence vs non-existence
If there is no movement, then the entire EM field (or movement field) would need to be in perfect balance and have been for all eternity.

Nothingness is simply the absence of movement. And to have no movement, everything has to be perfectly in balance so that there is no movement. The fabric of existence itself, the EM field, would need to cancel itself out completely. And since this perfect balance is statistically improbable, movement, and thus existence, arises. In this sense, even 'nothingness' would be a state of existence, one with no movement, but its improbability makes movement, and thus existence as we know it, inevitable.

This means that movement must have always been present, existing forever.

There would be no way for there to be no movement, ever.

The notion that existence has always been here may feel intuitively correct yet difficult to fully comprehend. It challenges our understanding of beginnings and endings, but it aligns with the idea that if existence is here now, it must have always been here, even if the notion of eternal existence is perplexing

So to recap, if there is movement, then there is existence.

And without movement, there is no existence.

While humans have existed for over 200,000 years, it is only within the past century that we detected the fabric of existence: the electromagnetic field.

Thus, in this understanding of existence, we see that movement, and only the convergence and divergence of movement alone, defines the fabric of reality.


## Our part of the universe begins
In this understanding of existence, where all arises from the convergence and divergence of movement, the observable part of existence began not from an infinitely dense point but from a large concentrated pool formed by the convergence of movement across vast distances. This pool would resemble a violent, multidirectional tornado of movement composed of what we now call light, both visible and invisible to our eyes, radiating in every direction.

The remnants of this pool of movement, dating back to approximately 14 billion years ago, are still observable today. What we observe as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is not evidence of a "Big Bang". Instead, it represents the faint electromagnetic echoes from this intense pool of movement that existed around 380,000 years after the convergence event commonly referred to as the "Big Bang". 

This reinterpretation eliminates the need for an initial singularity and establishes movement as the true origin of our observable universe. Singularities rely on assumptions of infinite density and energy, concepts that are unnecessary and untenable when reframing our part of the universe as arising from a pool of converged movement. Infinite density and energy lack support from empirical observations or experiments, making singularities an abstraction resulting from rewinding the clock of existence beyond the formation of the movement pool.

This perspective also reinterprets the redshift of galaxies and the so-called expansion of the universe. Rather than interpreting these phenomena as evidence of a singular explosive origin, they can be understood as objects moving away from each other through the vast electromagnetic field. The observed redshift, attributed to the expansion of space, instead reflects the increasing separation of objects as they move within the boundless electromagnetic field, the underlying fabric of existence. This perspective reframes the observed phenomenon as relative motion rather than an expansion of the spacetime fabric.

The homogeneity and isotropy of the CMB, typically viewed as evidence of a singular origin, can also be understood through the lens of a vast pool of movement. This pool would have begun in a relatively smooth and balanced state, reflecting the natural equilibrium of converging movement. The nearly uniform nature of the CMB reflects this initial smoothness. The slight variations we detect in the CMB may be remnants of ripples or disturbances within the movement pool during its initial convergence some 14 billion years ago, and these disturbances persist as observable features of the CMB.

This understanding reframes the origins of our observable universe, emphasizing the convergence of movement as its foundation, moving beyond the need for a singularity and redefining the fabric of existence itself.


## And then came stable particles
This pool of movement, I hypothesize, formed intense funnels of concentrated movement. At the very tip of each funnel, the movement was so intense and tightly focused that it ejected a stable, looped bit of movement, that we would call a particle.

I suspect the electron emerged first, its formation setting the stage for what came next. The presence of electrons might have created the conditions for another funnel to form, producing protons. Then, perhaps through a similar process, neutrons were created.

At some point, these particles began to combine, forming the simplest elements. Hydrogen, for example, emerged as a combination of a single proton and electron. It’s possible this process began even before the first neutrons were formed, with a sea of electron-proton pairs establishing the conditions for neutrons to emerge from an additional funnel.

This process wasn’t driven by forces like gravity but by the acceleration of particles around the pool of movement and their eventual ejection from it. Over time, particles converged and diverged, forming clouds of gas and dust that gave rise to stars, planets, and galaxies.

It is worth briefly noting the distinction between stable particles that emerged from the funnels in the initial pool of movement, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons, and transient particles that arise briefly under specific conditions. While countless particles can be "spun up" in laboratory experiments, accounting for many discovered over the past century, stability is a different matter entirely. Stable particles possess inherent structures that allow them to persist naturally over time, unlike transient particles which decay rapidly.

Many particles considered fundamental may actually be transient expressions of movement, lacking the inherent stability of truly fundamental particles. The Standard Model and its so-called fundamental particles, including quarks, will be explored in greater detail in a future discussion.


## No expanding universe, just accelerating acceleration
What we observe in the universe is everything moving away from everything else at an accelerating rate. This has been known since 1998, and since 2018, we have learned that the rate of acceleration itself is increasing.

This phenomenon is traditionally interpreted as the expansion of the universe. However, if we understand existence as only movement, it is not space expanding but objects moving through space, with the distances between them increasing over time.

What is attributed to "dark energy" as the driving force behind this acceleration is, in my understanding, the residual energy from the initial pool of movement some 14 billion years ago. The matter that formed stars, planets, and galaxies was ejected from this pool, and it is this imparted energy that continues to propel them through space, rather than being the result of the universe expanding, or more specifically, the spacetime fabric stretching.

But what about the increasing acceleration? If objects are accelerating at a growing rate, this implies the addition of energy, hence the concept of dark energy. Within the understanding that movement only exists, I propose that while the acceleration is increasing, the rate of this increase is gradually slowing. Over time, the accelerating motion subtly diminishes as the energy from the initial pool dissipates. This hypothesis would need to be verified experimentally, perhaps over years, decades, or even longer, but it offers a testable prediction for movement as the core of existence. Infinite energy cannot exist, and its gradual dissipation would need to be observed to account for this.

To summarize, the observed acceleration of cosmic objects is not due to space expanding but to objects moving through infinite space, driven by the energy imparted by the initial pool of movement. This reinterpretation eliminates the need for dark energy, provided the rate of increasing acceleration is indeed decreasing.


## On time, time slowing, and the arrow of time
Time is not some thing that moves forward, but is simply a way for us to keep track of movement and note how much movement has occurred. A pendulum, for example, is just a tool for keeping track of movement. Time doesn’t exist as an independent entity, but tracking movement allows us to derive meaning and order from events.

We have discovered that as objects move at any speed, time slows down for the moving object. This is a fact we rely on, and some of our technology, such as GPS, depends on this understanding of reality. But what does it mean for time to slow?

To answer this, we must understand that there is a speed limit to existence: the maximum speed at which movement can ripple through the fabric of existence. This is the speed of light, which is really the speed of the electromagnetic field, or simply the maximum speed of movement itself.

When an object begins to move, its internal processes, which are already operating at near-light speeds, must slow to compensate. The looped movement we call a particle is spinning internally, and if it were to also move at the speed of light, the combined motion would exceed the maximum limit of movement. To prevent this, the internal processes slow down as the object moves faster. This effect becomes increasingly pronounced as the object approaches the maximum speed of movement.

Since time is just a product of tracking movement, the concept of an "arrow of time" also dissolves. The arrow of time is often thought of as a force that moves forward through space, connecting with it to form spacetime. But there is no "time thing" permeating existence. Time is nothing more than our method of keeping track of movement and deriving meaning from it.


## On gravity and associated phenomena

### The illusion of falling
When you drop a book, it only appears as though it is moving toward the planet. In reality, it is also traveling far through the cosmos. The planet, along with everything on it, is accelerating through space on a specific trajectory toward distant regions. What we perceive as an object "falling" is, in fact, the object moving within this greater coordinated system through space, creating the illusion that it is only moving toward the planet. What we perceive as falling is not due to an inherent pull by the planet but is instead the relative motion of the already accelerating object merging with the planet’s accelerating path through space.

The book accelerates toward the planet not because of gravitational attraction or spacetime curvature, but because it is already in a state of synchronized acceleration along with the planet. This shared motion gives rise to what appears as a force but is actually a manifestation of converging movement paths. The sensation of weight arises because the planet resists the book's motion upon contact, creating an opposing force.

As an object moves closer to the center of a planet, its acceleration increases because the planet itself is accelerating through space. This effect can be understood as akin to moving down a funnel: the closer the object gets to the center of the planet’s mass, the more its motion must align with the planet’s accelerating trajectory. This not only amplifies acceleration but also influences the object’s internal processes. What is perceived as time slowing near the center arises because these processes slow down to remain consistent with the increased acceleration, ensuring the object stays within the universal speed limit of movement. Time slowing, in this understanding, is a natural and inevitable consequence of these dynamics.

### The illusion of orbits
Orbits are an illusion, too. Planets and other celestial bodies aren’t orbiting in the traditional sense but are spiraling together through space. What appears to be the sun holding the planets in orbit, either through its gravitational pull as suggested by Isaac or by curving spacetime as proposed by Albert, is actually the result of the coordinated motion of all objects in the solar system, including the sun, moving together through the cosmos. This synchronized spiraling movement creates the illusion of orbiting.

Galaxies aren’t being held together by mass, either. They, too, are spiraling through space. What appears as flat rotational motion is better understood as coordinated spiraling movement, a dynamic that eliminates the need for unseen forces attributed to "dark matter" or black holes at the centers of galaxies. This spiraling is part of a series of interconnected funnels originating from the first pool of movement. That initial pool created the funnels that formed particles and ejected everything else into space, establishing the synchronized spiraling motion we observe today and misinterpret as orbits.

Black holes and dark matter were both hypothesized based on the long-standing assumption that orbits are maintained by mass. This assumption also tied objects to an expanding spacetime fabric, rather than recognizing that objects are simply moving away from each other through space. In this understanding, objects are not held together by unseen forces but instead move in a synchronized, spiraling pattern through space. This reinterpretation eliminates the need for additional mass to explain their motion, making both black holes and dark matter unnecessary hypotheses for understanding orbits.

### On light bending
Black holes and dark matter were also hypothesized to explain the bending of light. Albert first hypothesized in General Relativity, later confirmed by observation, that light bends around mass. This phenomenon, known as gravitational lensing, or simply light path distortion, is traditionally attributed to the influence of mass on spacetime.

I propose, however, that light’s bending is better understood as it following the path of least resistance around a moving mass. Both the mass and the light are in motion through space, meaning the light’s path is shaped not only by the concentrated electromagnetic field surrounding the mass but also by the motion of the mass itself. As the mass moves, the light adjusts dynamically, tracing a more intricate path than it would if the mass were stationary.

Viewing the mass as stationary creates the illusion that the mass alone is responsible for bending the light. What we perceive to be light bending around a large mass, when understood through motion dynamics, is simply an interaction governed by the combined motion of both light and mass.

### On high energy emissions
Emissions, such as X-rays and high-energy radiation, traditionally attributed to black holes, I hypothesize, are better understood as intense outputs of electromagnetic interactions. These emissions arise from the high-energy dynamics of particles spiraling and accelerating within regions where movement is highly concentrated and converges intensely, combined with the motion of the entire system through space, which may amplify these interactions.

In regions such as the centers of galaxies or dense clusters of matter, particles experience extreme electromagnetic forces that accelerate them to nearly light speed, triggering collisions and interactions that release high-energy radiation. Rather than resulting from mass being drawn into a gravitational well, these emissions reflect the natural outputs of intense motion and electromagnetic activity occurring at these cosmic junctions. 

Observations of X-rays or gamma rays, therefore, do not require the existence of black holes but instead reveal the extreme dynamics of synchronized and highly concentrated motion within the electromagnetic field.

### Summary on gravity
This reinterpretation unifies our understanding of gravity, orbits, light bending, and high-energy emissions as expressions of synchronized, spiraling movement. What were once attributed to forces or constructs like dark matter, black holes, an attractive force, or spacetime curvature can now be understood through the dynamics of motion and the electromagnetic field. This eliminates the need for unseen constructs, offering a cohesive perspective that aligns with observed phenomena while providing a simpler, more unified understanding of the universe.


## On three dimensions, four dimensions, and beyond
We exist in a one-dimensional reality. Everything you see, feel, and experience can be traced back to this singular truth.

What we call "dimensions" are not physical entities but simply gridlines for tracking position and movement. Three dimensions are all that’s required to describe spatial positions. Adding more would introduce redundancy for describing position, but they could also be used to describe other aspects of existence beyond coordinates, such as tracking the energy within a system.

In spacetime, the fourth "dimension," time, is simply a way to account for the maximum speed of movement, the speed of light, and the effects this limit imposes. These effects include the slowing of internal processes within matter to account for the object's motion. Time doesn’t represent a separate physical entity but rather a conceptual adjustment used to track movement within this universal speed limit.

So, we don’t live in a three-dimensional or four-dimensional world. Instead, we exist in a one-dimensional reality. A world made of one thing. Gridlines can be drawn to track and describe movement, but they are tools, not fundamental aspects of existence.

Why, then, does superstring theory propose 10 dimensions, and M-theory suggest 11? These extra dimensions are not arbitrary. They provide a framework for tracking aspects of existence. Think of them as columns in a database. Each column tracks a specific feature of the one-dimensional reality we inhabit. Every movement or interaction can be seen as an 'entry' in this cosmic database, with each dimension tracking a specific property. They represent the minimal information needed to account for the movement of objects in existence.

What these dimensions represent, and why there are specifically 10 or 11, will be explored and explained in future work but are also left for the reader to ponder.


## On other universes
If movement is the core of everything and spans infinitely, it’s intuitive to consider that other parts of existence might form pools of movement. From these pools, particles could emerge, eventually giving rise to stars, planets, and galaxies, similar to what we observe in our own part of existence.

However, if such areas exist, I posit that we could never reach them. They would be so astronomically distant that traveling to them would be impossible within a human timeframe, constrained as we are by the universal speed limit, the speed of movement itself.

How likely are the conditions that created our observable universe? Is our universe a rare occurrence, or is it part of a larger pattern, with similar regions spread across the infinite expanse of existence, separated by unimaginable distances? Even if pools of movement are common, how often do conditions arise that allow for the formation of particles through funnels? Perhaps the creation of matter as we know it is exceedingly rare, or maybe it's exceedingly common?

The consideration of other pools of movement broadens our perspective on the infinite potential of existence, and hence the potential for life in other parts of reality.

These questions remain open for now, and I invite you to ponder them alongside me. Perhaps, together, we can one day figure out the probabilities of other pools of movement and the emergence of matter within them.


## On quantum mechanics, superposition, entanglement, and the EPR paradox
At its core, quantum mechanics is a framework for predicting movement using probabilities. While often interpreted to suggest that particles exist in multiple states simultaneously (superposition), this interpretation reflects a limitation in our ability to measure and predict their exact states, not an inherent property of reality. The "weirdness" of quantum mechanics arises more from our interpretations than from the phenomena themselves.

Quantum superposition is not about particles truly existing in multiple states at once. Instead, it reflects the uncertainty in predicting a particle's movement or position until an interaction occurs. When we measure a particle, we’re not collapsing multiple states into one but simply gaining clarity about a state that always existed, albeit beyond our immediate ability to observe.

Quantum entanglement is often described as a mysterious connection between particles, where the state of one instantly influences the other, regardless of distance. However, this "spooky action at a distance," as Albert called it, can be reinterpreted in simpler terms. Entangled particles are best understood as having synchronized movements, established during their interaction or creation. Once in sync, their behavior reflects this synchronization rather than requiring instantaneous communication over vast distances. For example, consider two particles created in a shared event, such as photon pairs in polarization experiments. Their synchronized behavior reflects their shared origin, not instantaneous communication.

This reinterpretation of entanglement also resolves a major challenge raised by Albert and his collaborators in the EPR paradox. The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox raised concerns about the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics. Albert argued against the notion that particles remain undetermined until observed, suggesting that quantum mechanics might be incomplete. In this explanation, the paradox is resolved by recognizing that entangled particles are not undetermined, but rather that they are synchronized from the start. Their movements reflect a shared system of dynamics, eliminating the need for hidden variables or faster-than-light communication.

Bell's Theorem demonstrated that local hidden variables could not account for the correlations observed in entangled particles. This understanding of entanglement eliminates the need for hidden variables entirely, upholding Bell's Theorem. The synchronization between particles is not a part of additional variables yet to be discovered, but an intrinsic feature of their shared movement dynamics, shaped by their past interactions. This interpretation aligns with Albert's resistance to the concept of faster-than-light communication while providing a straightforward, movement-based explanation for the observed behavior of so-called entangled particles, while also not contradicting Bell's Theorem.

By viewing quantum mechanics as a probability-based tool for predicting movement, its "strangeness" dissipates. Superposition becomes a reflection of uncertainty, not a physical state. Entanglement becomes a natural consequence of synchronized movement, not a mystical phenomenon. This perspective aligns with Albert's resistance to the standard interpretation, offering a more intuitive understanding of quantum behavior while fitting neatly into the broader understanding of movement as the core of existence. By grounding quantum mechanics in movement, this framework unifies the micro and macro scales of existence, dissolving apparent contradictions between classical and quantum realms.


## On the double-slit experiment and wave-particle duality
The double-slit experiment has long been a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, illustrating the so-called "wave-particle duality" of particles like electrons. When electrons are fired through two slits without observation, they form an interference pattern characteristic of waves. However, when a light source or detector is introduced to observe their paths, the interference pattern typical of waves disappears, leaving two distinct bands corresponding to the slits. This phenomenon has been a central puzzle in quantum mechanics for decades, leading to interpretations involving wavefunctions, probabilities, and the role of observation.

Reframed within the context of movement, this experiment becomes far less mysterious. Electrons do not "choose" between behaving like waves or particles. Instead, their behavior reflects the dynamics of the electromagnetic (EM) field and the movement within it. When the system is undisturbed, with no light or observation introduced, the electrons follow the natural flow of the EM field. This allows their paths to diffuse, interact, and create the interference pattern typical of waves. 

When light is introduced, additional movement is added to the EM field in the form of photons. These photons interact with the electrons, constraining their behavior and disrupting their natural, wave-like flow. The additional movement from the light concentrates the electrons' paths, causing them to behave more like localized particles. As a result, the interference pattern typical of waves disappears, leaving only the two distinct bands corresponding to the slits.

The key insight is that wave-particle duality is not an inherent property of the particles themselves, but a reflection of how their movement interacts with changes in the EM field. In an undisturbed field, the electrons exhibit wave-like behavior because their motion is not constrained, allowing for diffuse paths and overlapping interactions. In a disturbed field, such as when light is introduced, the additional movement constrains their motion, creating particle-like paths.

Historically, the "mystery" of wave-particle duality arose from the reliance on wavefunctions as a mathematical description of particle behavior. These wavefunctions led to interpretations that particles exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, and that the wavefunction collapses, or the particle now has a definite state. This interpretation, while useful mathematically, obscures the physical reality: particles like electrons always have definite states, but our ability to measure or predict them is probabilistic. The introduction of light, or the added movement introduced by photons, simply disturbs the particle's path by altering the conditions under which it travels.

The notion of observation as a pivotal element in the experiment also diminishes. It’s not the act of observing that changes the behavior of the electrons but the introduction of movement into the system through the act of observation. The added movement from the photons interacts with the electrons, disrupting their wave-like behavior and producing the particle-like pattern.

The dual-slit experiment is not a paradox when understood through the lens of movement. Electrons do not "switch" between being waves and particles but instead consistently respond to the movement dynamics of the EM field. The interference pattern typical of waves emerges from their ability to move freely in an undisturbed field, while the particle-like pattern results from constraints imposed by the additional movement introduced by the light. This explanation reframes wave-particle duality as a natural consequence of the interaction between particles and the EM field, rather than a paradoxical property of particles.


## On the Four Fundamental Forces
Forces aren’t distinct, independent entities. Instead, they are manifestations of movement. Just as gravity, as we've discussed, is not an attractive force or a spacetime well, but a reflection of the synchronized motion of objects through space, the other three so-called forces can be similarly reinterpreted as expressions of converging, diverging, and interacting movements.

### Electromagnetic Force
The electromagnetic (EM) force is already explicitly tied to the movement of charged particles within the EM field. Unlike a "force" in the traditional sense, it can be understood as the interaction of moving charges and their effect on each other’s motion. Particles that "repel" or "attract" each other are simply following paths dictated by how their individual movements synchronize or diverge relative to one another. 

This interaction doesn’t require the concept of a force field pulling or pushing them. Instead, particles are following the natural flow of movement shaped by their shared motion within the electromagnetic field. The EM field itself, in this understanding, is the foundational medium of movement through which all interactions take place.

### Strong Nuclear Force
The strong nuclear force, often described as the "glue" that holds protons and neutrons together within the atomic nucleus, can also be reinterpreted. Rather than envisioning a "force" that binds particles, we see it as a convergence of movement. Instead of particles being actively "held together" by an external force, they are simply maintaining a stable, synchronized movement relative to each other. This explains the sense of "binding" seen in nucleons (protons and neutrons) within the nucleus. The tighter the convergence, the stronger the bond appears, but in reality, it is a byproduct of particles sharing a convergent path of movement.

### Weak Nuclear Force
The weak nuclear force, in contrast, is traditionally seen as the force responsible for particle decay or radioactive processes. Within the movement framework, this process can be seen as a form of divergence. When the paths of certain subatomic particles can no longer maintain convergence, the particles shift to a new, more stable movement pattern. This shift results in the decay of particles and the creation of new particles (as in beta decay).

In this view, decay is not the result of a separate "force" acting on a particle but a natural shift in the particle’s movement dynamics. The breakdown of convergence allows for new particle arrangements to emerge. It is simply the reorganization of movement into a more stable form, and the so-called "weak force" is a conceptual label placed on this process rather than a true, independent force.

### Reframing the Four Forces
If we take this all together, the idea of forces as separate, distinct phenomena dissolves. Gravity is not an attractive force or spacetime well, but synchronized movement. The electromagnetic force is not a force field but the natural interaction of charges through the EM field. The strong force is not a binding force but the result of convergent movement paths. The weak force is not a force that causes decay but the natural divergence of previously stable motion paths.

So, what we perceive as "forces" are better understood as the effects of converging, diverging, and synchronized movement paths. By removing the concept of "force" and instead focusing on the nature of movement, we simplify and unify our understanding of existence. No unseen forces are needed, only the logic of movement. 


## On entropy
Entropy is traditionally described as the tendency for systems to move from order to disorder, often associated with the spreading out of energy and the eventual "heat death" of the universe. In this framework of existence, entropy can be reinterpreted as the natural divergence of movement while simultaneously allowing for new convergences to occur. This perspective shifts the view of entropy from one of inevitable decay to one of ongoing transformation.

Rather than seeing entropy as a one-way journey toward maximum disorder, it is better understood as the spreading of movement. As movement diverges, it can create the conditions for new pools of movement, giving rise to fresh pockets of order. These pools are where matter, structure, and complexity can emerge once again. This cyclical process suggests that existence is never truly "running down" but is instead in a constant state of reorganization and rebirth.

The traditional view of entropy implies that the universe will eventually reach a state of maximum disorder or "heat death," where no usable energy remains. But if we understand existence as pure movement, then even in the so-called "final state," movement does not stop. Instead, it continues to converge and diverge, meaning that the emergence of new forms, new order, and even new "pools of existence" remains a possibility. This understanding challenges the idea of an ultimate end-state for existence, replacing it with a vision of continuous transformation.

From this perspective, entropy is not the end of order but a process by which movement spreads, creates space for new interactions, and allows for new convergences to occur. These new convergences are the birthplaces of particles, energy systems, and even life itself. Movement diverges, but from that divergence, new alignments can naturally arise. Seen this way, entropy becomes less of a "universal doom" and more of an essential process for the emergence of complexity, renewal, and infinite potential.


## On life
If movement is the foundation of existence, then it must also explain the phenomenon of life. Life can be understood as a complex system of converged and harnessed movement, intricately organized to sustain and replicate itself.

At its core, life is driven by movement. The base unit of movement for life is ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a molecule that powers nearly all biological processes. ATP functions as a chemical system of movement, storing and releasing energy through reactions that fuel the processes essential for life. In this sense, life itself is the organization and harnessing of movement at an advanced scale.

Billions of years ago, I posit that chemical reactions led to the formation of ATP and its integration into other molecular systems. Over time, these systems began to harness movement not only to sustain themselves but to replicate. This marked a critical transition: movement evolving into self-replicating systems capable of perpetuating their organization and complexity. Life, as we know it, emerged as a byproduct of this harnessing and replication of movement.

From these early chemical processes, more refined and complex systems arose, ultimately giving rise to the diverse forms of life we observe today. At every stage, life’s essence remains rooted in its ability to organize movement into functional systems that sustain themselves and enable replication.

While ATP is the primary molecule that powers nearly all biological processes, there are exceptions. Ion gradients, for instance, directly harness movement across membranes to drive energy conversion, such as in the proton pumps of mitochondria. Similarly, sunlight powers certain reactions in photosynthesis before ATP becomes involved. Molecules like GTP (guanosine triphosphate) also serve as alternative energy carriers in specific processes, such as protein synthesis.

These systems, though distinct, still align with the principle of movement as the core of existence. Whether it is the movement of ions across membranes, the rippling energy of sunlight, or the molecular dynamics of GTP or ATP, life is fundamentally about organizing and harnessing movement to sustain and replicate itself.


## On consciousness
Consciousness need not be viewed as an elusive or mystical phenomenon. Our perception of being alive, or consciousness, can be understood as a highly complex system of movement within the brain.

The idea that consciousness is an ephemeral essence pervading space and time is unnecessary in this framework. Instead, it emerges naturally as a product of organized movement. Some have hypothesized that everything in existence, down to individual particles, possesses some form of consciousness. Yet, if existence is understood as movement, this interpretation becomes untenable. Consciousness is not an inherent property of all movement but rather a specific, highly organized configuration of it, found within living systems.

Far from being magical or mysterious, consciousness is a phenomenon that can be studied, understood, and one day possibly even replicated. This opens the door to the possibility of creating computational systems that achieve a level of computation analogous to our own consciousness. However, just like natural consciousness, artificial consciousness would also be composed of movement, with its foundation tied to the dynamics of movement, the electromagnetic field.

One final note, the term “conscious” is often used to describe an awareness of something, whether internal thoughts or external stimuli. Alongside this, the concept of the “unconscious” reflects aspects of brain activity and development that occur outside our direct awareness. However, whether we speak of conscious awareness or unconscious processes, both are rooted in intricate patterns of movement within the brain.


## On the meaning of life
The question *What is the meaning of life?* assumes there is some external or predefined "meaning" to life. But life is not about searching for meaning imposed from the outside. Instead, life is movement: complex, organized, and self-sustaining. It is not about why life exists, but how it exists and what it does.

Life is movement's greatest achievement: its ability to organize, harness, and sustain itself. It replicates with modification, grows, and creates endlessly intricate forms. To ask for a meaning beyond this misses the essence of what life already is: the organization of movement into forms capable of self-awareness, creativity, and connection.

The "purpose" of life, if any, is to recognize and embrace this truth. Life is about understanding its nature and using that understanding to create, to thrive, and to elevate existence for all. It is about realizing that suffering and division are abnormalities, not the norm. The natural state of life, when fully understood and harnessed, is unity, growth, and shared flourishing.

So, the "meaning" of life is not an external answer but an invitation to participate in existence, to recognize the interconnectedness of all things, and to make life as extraordinary and fulfilling as possible for everyone. Life is not about finding meaning but about experiencing it to its fullest potential.

The question *What is the meaning of life?* often comes from a place of frustration, struggle, or existential doubt. It reflects a deep yearning to make sense of suffering and to justify existence when life feels hard or unjust. In a world where humanity fully understands and embraces the essence of existence, where joy, connection, and shared flourishing become the norm, that question would naturally dissolve. If life is no longer defined by struggle, isolation, or inequality, the need to ask why fades, replaced by a deep sense of how to thrive together.

Joy, when universally accessible, becomes its own answer. In a world of joy, the search for 'meaning' no longer feels necessary. When people experience a world without unnecessary suffering, the focus shifts from justifying life to celebrating life. In such a reality, life isn't about questioning its worth. It's about living its fullness, together, as one interconnected existence. The question disappears because its premise, the difficulty of life, ceases to exist.

This understanding calls us to end suffering, foster connection, and live life to its fullest. By doing so, we no longer need to ask what life means. We will know it in every shared moment of joy, unity, and growth.

How would you reinterpret these ideas through the lens that movement is the essence of existence?

And if you're looking to explain other phenomena, take a look over this page on Wikipedia titled [List of unsolved problems in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics). Though some questions have been discussed in detail in this document, there are many waiting a reintepretation under the understanding of movement.

There is also a general index of [Lists of unsolved problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_unsolved_problems) that would likely also benefit from a deeper look. I haven't delved too deep into anything not already mentioned. I'm interested in seeing how others tackle known questions.

Thank you for taking the time to engage with these ideas. Exploring the fundamental nature of existence is no small feat, and your willingness to ponder these concepts speaks to the shared human curiosity that drives us to understand our place in the universe. This document is not the conclusion but a beginning, and I invite you to join me in furthering this exploration.

I look forward to continuing this journey together.
