## Introduction
While the ideas in this document are rooted in personal experiences and observations, they are open to verification through conversation, observation by others, and neuroimaging, such as examining brain activity during moments of chin sensation. However, the ultimate validation will arise not from laboratory studies but from individuals globally experiencing chin sensations and feeling them regularly, if not daily.

### On Reclaiming the Chin
All humans can regain this chin sensation, and in doing so, restore a natural mechanism that fosters deep thought, problem-solving, and cooperation. Restoring the chin’s function requires more than just physical awareness: it calls for a shift in mindset. To reconnect with this lost sensation, we must move away from feelings of aggression, hate, and blame, which create division. Instead, we must cultivate understanding, cooperation, and harmony, which promote group cohesion.

Reclaiming the chin sensation is not an instant fix. It is a gradual process that requires years of mental and physical practice. The mental work requires dedication to preventing conflict. The physical work, particularly addressing deep-seated tension in the head and neck, as well as throughout the entire body from head to toe, is necessary to begin to release the systemic body tension that prevents feeling the chin sensations, and more importantly, to reduce past body inflammation and to simply feel regular again. This is an intensive, energy-demanding journey that requires daily dedication. Progress will be made from day one, but it will take at least a few years to fully heal and regain the chin sensations.

The physical sensations of the chin provide a feedback mechanism that has the potential to profoundly shape our social behaviors and interactions, as it likely did in our earliest days some 200,000 to 300,000 years ago. This feature, which would have fostered creativity by promoting deep reflection and ultimately group cohesion, was likely instrumental in allowing humans to form large, cooperative groups, or simply to work peacefully alongside other groups without resorting to battles for territory and resources. Rather than relying on aggression to secure resources, the chin's feedback mechanism would have promoted problem-solving and reduced conflict.

### On Humanity Losing the Chin
So when did we lose the ability to sense the chin?

Chin sensations are lost during moments of fear or uncertainty, as I reason the brain prioritizes action over thought, a concept I will discuss in greater detail in this document. This permanent loss of chin sensations would have occurred during childhood, as it did for me, leaving adults to either forget these sensations entirely or perhaps never notice them in the first place.

My reasoning is that this loss likely occurred around the time hierarchical groups began forming, approximately 10,000 years ago. Once division emerged, we started working against each other rather than with each other, and humanity entered a constant state of unresolved conflict, stemming from early childhood.

Losing the chin isn't simply the loss of the ability to think, but also results in the body being locked in a heightened state. As a result of this heightened state, the body remains in a state of chronic inflammation, from head to toe. This inflammation—including that in the brain—has, in my reasoning, contributed to a range of conditions. By reducing this widespread inflammation, we could potentially eradicate many inflammatory-based issues, such as balding, skin conditions like keratosis pilaris (KP), and even some types of cancers. Other chronic illnesses linked to systemic inflammation could also be alleviated or prevented as part of this broader healing process. A deeper and more formal look into the potential for healing many ailments will need to be conducted collectively to pinpoint all health benefits that will result from regaining the chin and healing past inflammation.

### On the Aftermath and Our Potential Future
The loss of the chin as a tool for cooperation has led to thousands of years of conflict. The toll on humanity has been both tragic and deadly. The implications of reclaiming the chin are vast, not only in reducing the physical toll on individuals but also in healing society as a whole.

To reach our highest potential, humanity must reconnect with this lost sensation. In doing so, we can return to our natural, cooperative state, free from unnecessary conflict and tension. This process holds the key to unlocking a future of collective prosperity and peace. With the chin restored, humanity could thrive indefinitely, guided by creativity and cooperation, ensuring progress not just in the coming decades, but for millions and billions of years to come.



## Exploring the Uniqueness of the Human Chin
Did you know that the chin is uniquely human? No other known species, past or present, shares this feature.

Have you ever wondered why humans have chins or what purpose they serve? This question has puzzled humans since we first noticed them in the 1800s.

Unlike other features we share or have shared with other species like large brains, similar to those of Neanderthals, or feet like those of the earliest upright walkers who roamed this planet over 6 million years ago, the chin stands alone as a distinctive feature of human anatomy. 

Around two to three million years ago, beings somewhat like us began to appear. Their brains were larger than those of the earliest upright walkers, yet they still lacked a chin. The pronounced bone protrusion in the lower jaw of upright walkers became a defining feature only about 200,000 to 300,000 years ago, a relatively recent moment in the long history of upright walkers and the even longer history of primates, mammals, and terrestrial life. The emergence of the chin led to the eventual persistence of beings with distinct physical traits including a chin, which we now refer to as Homo sapiens sapiens, or simply humans.

Following the emergence of this unique feature, all other species of upright walkers eventually died out, with the last of the chinless walkers, the Neanderthals, going extinct just 40,000 years ago.

You might be surprised to learn that all humans have chins. When I first learned that chins were unique to humans, I was initially puzzled as I had thought that some people lacked them. However, the reality is that every human possesses this distinct protrusion at the bottom of their jawbone. The apparent absence or presence of a chin in different individuals is often a matter of how the soft tissue and fat are distributed around the jawline, not an indication that the chin bone protrusion is missing.

Have you come across any of the [prevailing theories](https://www.npr.org/2016/01/29/464893281/why-do-humans-have-chins-a-scientist-explains-the-enduring-puzzle) about why humans have chins? None have been definitively proven true. You might have heard that chins aid in chewing or speaking. Or perhaps you've heard theories suggesting chins emerged to help withstand punches or that chins play a role in reproductive selection. All reasonable ideas to consider, yet, none of these explanations has been conclusively supported by evidence.



## So What's a Chin For?
The chin is a tool that helps us think creatively, develop novel solutions, and ultimately avoid physical conflicts within our group, fostering cooperation instead.

The chin accomplishes this by tingling when we've arrived at a solution to a problem. This tingling sensation serves as a feedback mechanism, signaling that our brain has resolved a conflict through cooperation and moved us away from possible confrontation.

And how do I know all this? Well, let me tell you.

### My Journey of Chin Rediscovery
Starting in 2016 and primarily in 2017, I began doing significant mental work, driven by the need to rethink both my perspective of myself and my understanding of humanity at large. At the time, I was not aware of the uniqueness of the chin, nor did I have any conscious memory of any chin sensations from childhood.

This process of mental recovery that I began required deep reflection and analysis, sparking a journey of self-exploration and healing, and over the months many past childhood memories, some long forgotten, began to resurface as I delved deeper into my own mind.

By mid-2020, I had already made significant progress in understanding my mind and its processes, and I began to notice physical tension and inflammation in my body, particularly around my head. At this point, I developed techniques for reducing the tension around my head, including breaking down tissue using my fingers and fingernails, pinching and pulling on the inflamed regions, and sometimes causing minor injuries as part of the healing process, which resulted in scabbing and bleeding. Though painful at times, I recognized this as part of the healing process, more akin to the 'therapeutic pain' often associated with physical therapy rather than destructive pain.

I'll discuss these techniques in greater detail in a later section, guiding you to also relieve this tension in the head, and as I would soon learn, relieve tension that had persisted all across my body, from head to toe, since childhood.

Though I didn't know it at the time, I was preparing my mind and body for reconnecting with chin sensations. Although I recognized this tension around my head as an indication of stress built up from childhood, I would only later connect it to the chin and these childhood sensations.

In late 2020 or early 2021, I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D5CQ98kll4) that first introduced me to the uniqueness of the human chin. Within days or weeks of watching the video, memories of my chin tingling began to return. The realization of the chin’s uniqueness triggered these childhood memories, even though I hadn’t yet physically felt the tingling sensation again. My ongoing mental work, and likely the physical work of relieving tension in my head, had both primed me for this rediscovery, allowing the memories to surface. Without this mental healing, I might not have reconnected with these childhood sensations.

### Reconnecting With Childhood Memories of the Chin
One particular memory stood out. As a child, likely as young as a few years old but no older than eight, sometime in the 1980s, I was upset about something involving one of my siblings, the specifics of which have faded from memory. I sat on my bed, pondering the situation, when a new understanding suddenly dawned on me. It was a solution to the problem, one my mother had suggested earlier, but it hadn't clicked until that moment. As the realization hit, my chin tingled, a kind of vibration. The feeling of being upset began to dissipate immediately, and I felt an equilibrium again, no longer feeling the need to be in conflict over the matter.

That day, soon after having this moment of clarity, my mother came to check up on me. I recall asking her if her chin ever tingled when she got an idea. I didn't really want to admit to her that the idea I came up with was actually the solution she had suggested earlier and that it wasn't until I sat alone in my room and pondered it that it made sense to me.

After I asked her if her chin had ever tingled, it seemed she instantly recalled a memory of it happening. She suggested it might only happen to kids, implying that her chin no longer tingled as an adult. Then we never spoke about the chin again.

So, when it comes to understanding what a chin is for, it wasn’t adult me who figured it out, it was kid me, and in hindsight it makes sense that all children, with the right environment and given time to reflect and think, notice their chins and its association with ideas. Given the high stress environments that many children grow up in, it makes sense that many, if not most children, never are given the time and space to reflect and notice body sensations.

At the time, I didn’t realize that the tingling sensation in my chin was part of a much larger mystery regarding its purpose, one that has perplexed humans ever since its uniqueness to humans was discovered. As a young child, I didn’t think to share this with anyone besides my mother, let alone consider telling the scientific community.

### The "Pop" Sensation
In addition to the chin sensation during moments of understanding, I vividly recall experiencing another significant sensation: a "pop" at a specific point on the top left of my head, near the front, which occurred as stress was being resolved during a state of perceived threat. I remember moments of fear and uncertainty as a young child, often due to family matters that needed resolution. These situations were usually resolved through simple social interactions, such as my mother's comforting words, reassuring me that there was no reason to be upset. After her words, the "pop" would come just before the tingling in my chin returned, signaling stress relief, and highlighting the crucial role social bonds play in managing stress and fear, ultimately promoting group cohesion.

Accompanying the pop were a series of sensations around the head, along with a pronounced tingling in my chin, which together signaled the restoration of a return to normal. The tingling in the chin signaled to me that normal, daily function of it had resumed. Today I reason that in moments of fear, or simply in moments of uncertainty, the brain prioritizes immediate action over reflection, causing the cognitive functions associated with the chin to temporarily take a backseat to automatic action. These functions return only after the moment of fear, or uncertainty, is resolved.

### Reflecting on the Chin and the Sore Spot
Do you recall this spot on your head popping and the accompanying rippling feeling of relief occurring right after this sore spot popped, particularly on the left side of your face? The sensation would travel down the left side of the face, with the left ear popping (possibly also the right, though I can't recall certainly), relief spreading through the left cheek, down along the jawline, and finally, the chin tingling.

And do you recall this spot being sore, prompting you to rub it as a child? I distinctly remember doing so, and vividly recall a day when I saw one of my siblings doing the same. On that day, I also realized that anger provided relief from the pain in that sore spot, and remember being rather upset about something unrelated to my sibling. As my sibling rubbed the spot, I remember thinking that being angry seemed better than the state I had been stuck in, with that spot being sore, my chin gone, and conflict persisting within the family.



## The Sequence of the "Pop" Sensation and Chin Recovery
In this section, I'll go over details of the recovery process that I recall from childhood, including additional memories that came along with the process.

As an adult, I am still in a healing process and feel that I am nearing a point where I will experience the "pop," along with the rippling sensations of relief I'll describe below. Though the pop hasn't happened yet, I am able to feel my chin sensations during moments of thought, cooperation, and a general avoidance of conflict with other humans.

- **Initial Pop**: The first and most significant pop occurred at a point on the top left side of my head after coming out of a fearful state. This sensation acted as a primary trigger, signaling the beginning of the transition out of a fearful state.
- **Second Pop near the Widow's Peak**: Shortly after the initial pop, a secondary pop occurred near the left widow's peak, further facilitating the cascading effect of stress release across my head.
- **Ear Pop and Sensory Flow**: Simultaneously, my left ear would experience a pop, akin to the sensation of water clearing from the ear canal, which enhanced the feeling of physical clearing or release. I’m unsure, but there may have also been a clearing of the right ear.
- **Cascading Down to the Chin**: After the secondary pop near the widow's peak, the sensation traveled along the left side of my face, moving down across the left cheek and along the jawline, before culminating in a pronounced tingling at the chin.
- **Relief in the Right Hemisphere**: As the sensations reached the chin, the right hemisphere of my brain would nearly simultaneously experience a relieving feeling—a sense of relaxation or release that suggests a bilateral involvement in the stress response and its resolution. Concurrently, there was a marked enhancement in the ability to visualize mentally, suggesting an increase in cognitive processing capabilities.  I recall the visualizations becoming more vivid and intense, which makes sense since the chin, central to thinking and problem-solving, had resumed its function. As the chin returned, so did the mental clarity and heightened acuity associated with it.
- **Vision Clarity and Cognitive Enhancements**:
  - **Color Perception**: During the moment of stress release, my visual clarity improved noticeably, with colors becoming more vivid and sharply contrasting with the previously subdued color spectrum.
  - **Vision Relaxation and Unblurring**: My overall vision relaxed significantly, shifting away from the focused, strained state I maintained during prolonged stressful states. I recall needing to exert effort just to keep my vision clear.
  


## Losing the Chin and Gaining Cognitive Resilience in Childhood
Not long after I made this childhood discovery of the chin, I lost the chin tingling sensations altogether. One particular memory stands out: a day when, as a child, I faced an unresolved conflict. My mother, instead of offering her usual comforting words, left me with the sense that I needed to resolve the issue on my own. Though I can’t recall exactly what she said, the message was clear: this time, I had to find my own way through the problem.

This day marked a significant turning point for me. Typically, resolving such conflicts was accompanied by the familiar and comforting sensations in my chin and head, which felt like rewards for achieving resolution. But on this day, the conflict remained unresolved. I initially felt upset but gradually adopted a dismissive attitude toward the loss of my chin tingling, eventually thinking, "I don't even need it." Despite this self-assurance, I couldn’t fully shake the feeling of loss.

Even though I knew I had lost the chin sensation, which had been an indicator of resolving stress, I reassured myself by acknowledging that I had learned to think deeply on my own. I no longer needed the physical sensation of the chin to confirm my cognitive abilities. This realization was both liberating and a bit melancholic, as it represented both a loss of a feeling I had grown to cherish, yet was in a way a step toward solidifying reliance on my own thoughts and ideas.

For decades, I didn’t reflect on this loss, thinking I no longer needed the chin sensation. Over time, I had completely forgotten about the sensations and what they represented. It wasn’t until recently, when memories of my chin resurfaced, that I realized the profound impact of this loss. Though I had retained the ability to think deeply, I recognized that regaining the chin sensation would serve as a physical mechanism, confirming when my ideas had successfully shifted from a potentially confrontational state into one of cooperation.
