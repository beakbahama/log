# The Tale of the Greedy Sovereign and the Lonely Moon

In the early days of our world, when nations were young and wisdom was ancient, there lived a sovereign of unparalleled ambition. This ruler, known as Sovereign Avarum, was consumed by a desire not merely to govern but to possess all that the eye could see and beyond.

Avarum’s kingdom, initially prosperous and vast, soon became the heart of his insatiable greed. He took from his people not only their wealth but also the fruits of their labor, the joy of their hearts, and the peace of their days. 

Sovereign Avarum's greed knew no bounds. With each passing year, his desire whispered darkly of taking not merely the riches or the lands, but the very air his subjects breathed. Obsessed with amassing all to himself, he devised a monstrous plan—to consume so much that his body would hoard all the oxygen, denying it to others.

As his empire expanded, so did Avarum's body, each conquest feeding his ceaseless hunger and swelling his form to grotesque proportions. His shadow grew vast and ominous, casting a chill over the lands he had stripped of vitality and light.

Driven to madness by his insatiable greed, Avarum proclaimed a dreadful edict, "If the air is mine, then none shall breathe without my leave!" With this decree, he began a gluttonous rampage, consuming the world's reserves in a vain effort to grow so vast that he might capture all the breath of life itself. But as he gorged himself beyond the limits of mortal excess, a peculiar fate befell him. His bloated body, now hoarding a critical mass of oxygen, began to operate beyond the established boundaries of the physical realm.

Avarum, in his greed, had become so vast that the earth could no longer hold him. Slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, he floated upwards, swelling and expanding until he was no longer a man but a vast, pale sphere. The darkness that had shrouded the kingdom, a shadow cast by his once overbearing presence of greed, began to lift as he rose higher, allowing the sun's rays to bathe the land in light once more.

The people who had lived under his tyrannical rule stood and watched, some in horror, others in quiet relief, as their ruler’s form blurred and ballooned, transcending the bonds of earth and rising toward the firmament. There in the sky was no longer their sovereign but a stark and lonely sphere.

This pale, silent watcher drifted eternally above, reflecting the sun's light but producing none of its own. It served as a daily reminder to those below of the dangers of allowing one's desires to eclipse the common good. And so, Avarum, once a ruler consumed by the desire to possess everything, became a symbol of the very isolation his greed had wrought, an eternal witness to the world he could no longer control.

As Avarum's once formidable presence diminished, the oppressive darkness that had blanketed the kingdom began to recede. The sun's rays pierced through the lingering shadows, bathing the land in a light that felt almost forgotten. The fields, long barren under the chill of Avarum’s greed, slowly stirred to life, hinting at a hopeful rebirth.

The people, gathered in the newly illuminated squares and vibrant fields, shared glances of mutual understanding and relief. The elders spoke of times before Avarum’s rule, while children basked in the liberating light, their joyful laughter restoring a melody to the air that had long been missing. They spoke often of Avarum’s Lament, the name they had given to the lonely sphere that was their former ruler. It hung in the sky, a pale reminder of the past, yet also a beacon for the future, illuminating their nights and guiding their decisions.

Together, they pledged anew to cherish the light and the freedom it represented. They vowed to manage their resources with care, ensuring that the shadows of greed would never again darken their days. In this renewed spirit, the community found not just survival but a path to thrive, guided always by the haunting but hopeful glow of their lonely moon.
