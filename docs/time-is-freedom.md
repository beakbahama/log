## On the Path Forward
Over the past several years, I've embarked on an unexpected and profound period of introspection and exploration, initially driven by a personal need for solitude. This reflection was not intended to produce a plan to solve humanity's problems, but rather to understand myself in deeper, clearer ways. However, as I delved further into the complexities of my experiences and thoughts, it became evident that the challenges we face collectively are intricately tied to the individual struggles we all endure.

The understanding I’ve gained about humanity’s struggles—particularly the failure to create environments where humans can thrive from birth in supportive conditions—has not only been enlightening, but it has also revealed a tangible pathway toward an incredible future for all. A future where everyone prospers, free from conflict and harm, and where each individual enjoys extreme comfort and safety.

In this future, every hand is held through genuine and robust support systems integrated into the fabric of daily life. Every heart loved through community structures that ensure no one is isolated or overlooked. Every thought nurtured with educational systems designed to foster critical thinking and creativity from the earliest ages. And every word spoken is heard, valued, and integrated, creating a society where communication and deep understanding form the backbone of our collective decision-making, reflecting our new, incredible, interconnected, community based, and family-strong global civilization.

The concept of luxury will become outdated because the basics of everyday human living will encompass what was once considered a luxury for a select few: economic stability, a high level of housing, minimal work, and no worry of ever paying for a bill or a vacation ever again. This is not a distant utopia, but a real possibility grounded in the capabilities and resources we already possess today.

Housing will not merely be about providing shelter but about crafting spaces where individuals and families can thrive. Homes where even the smallest apartment is a haven of comfort and functionality, equipped with amenities that enrich daily living. In this society, the outdated notion of a middle class dissolves as everyone accesses a quality of life that includes the best of what we can achieve.

The idea of labor itself needs a complete reevaluation. Do most people really need to work 40+ hours a week? The pandemic revealed just how much of the working world is redundant and unnecessary. With current capabilities, we can recalibrate the global workweek to prioritize personal growth and community involvement over exhaustive labor. We have the resources to create an incredible society while limiting intensive work to an average of just two days a week. Further, by fostering early retirement into mentorship roles by age 50, individuals will have the freedom to invest their time in passions, relationships, and civic duties. These fundamental shifts will enhance both the quality of life and societal health for everyone.

And so, as my solitude turned into a broader social awareness, it became clear that the path to an improved future was not just a series of steps to be taken but a shift in understanding what is fundamentally possible. We have never been closer to achieving a society where suffering is not an inevitable part of the human condition but a relic of past systems and attitudes.

To all who have felt the weight of the world's challenges: we hold the power to reshape our reality into one of universal support, respect, and prosperity. Together, we can liberate individuals to pursue lives filled with learning, creativity, and personal fulfillment.



## Introducing: The Global Institution Framework
The GI framework is designed to ensure that prosperity is accessible to everyone, transforming it from a mere possibility to a guarantee. It is centered on the goal that all basic and essential human needs—including housing, healthcare, education, and creative fulfillment—are universally accessible and serve as the foundation of a thriving society. The framework replaces traditional governmental structures and NGOs with a unified system where essential services are centralized through collective efforts and advanced technologies. This approach sets to make taxation for common human essentials obsolete, shifting towards a system where community contributions directly fund societal needs.

The framework fosters a culture of creativity and innovation, empowering individuals across all societal segments to explore and develop their creative potential in an environment that nurtures innovation and artistic expression. Inclusivity is a cornerstone of this framework, ensuring that everyone, including those with troubled pasts or those currently incarcerated, as well as individuals from all backgrounds and abilities, is actively included and valued.

This framework is not just a presentation of ideas but an invitation to engage with a movement poised to redefine liberty in our time. It challenges each of us to reconsider what freedom truly means. True freedom is not merely the absence of physical restraints but the presence of opportunities to live a fulfilled and joyful life. The incessant demands of modern work and the stress they entail can be as constricting as any chain. By advocating for a two-day workweek and ensuring early retirement, the GI framework not just proposes a reduction in hours but a fundamental transformation in the very essence of freedom. This change would allow every individual to reclaim time to engage deeply with their passions, communities, and families, crafting lives that are not just productive but genuinely fulfilling.

The GI framework is designed to envelop the entire planet, serving as a universal system into which every human can integrate. It acts as a comprehensive global social contract for modern times, aiming to ensure that everyone, everywhere can access the foundations of a dignified life. By making the GI available to all, it functions as a global wrapper that promises to diminish the inequities and disparities caused by historical and geographic accidents. This universal approach doesn't just invite participation—it requires collective engagement as a fundamental aspect of its design.

## Four Critical Steps to World Amazing

### Step One: Global Discussion
The first step in establishing the GI is to launch a worldwide discussion, inviting people from all walks of life to share ideas, connect, and collectively influence the development of the GI framework. This global dialogue will transcend borders, fostering collaboration and mutual understanding that shapes the core principles of the GI.

- **Platforms for Engagement**: The discussion will take place on a variety of platforms to ensure accessibility for everyone, including online forums, social media, local town halls, and global video conferences. By utilizing diverse channels, we will engage people from different cultures, languages, and backgrounds.
- **Facilitating Inclusion**: To ensure that no voice is left unheard, translation services, accessibility tools, and regional moderators will be provided. Special emphasis will be placed on reaching marginalized communities, those living in remote areas, and individuals with limited access to technology, ensuring a truly global dialogue.
- **Structured and Open Discussions**: The conversation will be both structured and organic. We will have specific topics and frameworks to guide discussions, but there will also be open spaces for people to share new ideas, concerns, and innovations that haven't yet been considered. This balance will help shape the GI in ways that are both targeted and flexible.
- **Local Meetups and Events**: In addition to digital platforms, we will encourage local gatherings and meetups to foster face-to-face discussions. Community-based events and forums will allow people to build stronger local connections while contributing to the global conversation. Partnerships with community centers, educational institutions, and local governments will help coordinate these efforts.
- **Feedback Loops**: As discussions evolve, participants will have the opportunity to provide feedback on key proposals. These feedback loops will be transparent, ensuring that all contributions are considered in the development of the GI framework. Regular updates will be provided to keep the global community informed and engaged.
- **Long-Term Vision**: This global dialogue will not be a one-time event but an ongoing process. As the GI framework evolves, the dialogue will continue, fostering constant adaptation, innovation, and refinement of the institution based on the needs and desires of the global population.


### Step Two: Funding the Core Fund and Beyond
The GI aims to raise $25 trillion by engaging one billion people, each contributing $25,000. From this, 4%—or $1 trillion—will be allocated annually to fund operations and projects from 2025 to 2050. These resources will be used to acquire land, build infrastructure, and create self-sufficient communities.

Each member’s contribution is placed into a personal fund under their control, ensuring transparent and democratic spending decisions. The funds are used solely to acquire resources and support the community, with no portion going to personal salaries or enrichment.

For those unable to pay upfront, membership can be earned through meaningful work, ensuring that financial barriers do not limit participation. This guarantees inclusivity and equal opportunity for all. All members, regardless of financial contribution, have a voice in how funds are allocated, fostering shared governance.

Members can also grow their personal funds by participating in or initiating GI projects. Those who contribute to projects that generate revenue retain full control over the profits, which are split 50/50. Half of the earnings are directed to funding additional GI initiatives, while the other half goes into the personal funds of those involved. This structure allows members to use their earnings for non-essential purchases not covered by the GI core fund.

Higher membership levels beyond the core GI membership will be available to reflect deeper engagement. These levels can be achieved through direct contributions, project revenues, or exceptional service. This tiered membership system incentivizes active participation and ensures that project success directly benefits both individual members and the broader GI community, expanding the GI’s global impact.


### Step Three: Implementation Phases
The implementation of the Global Institution will be carried out in distinct phases to ensure efficiency, adaptability, and sustainability. Early members will play a crucial role in setting up and maintaining the infrastructure required for self-sustaining communities.

In the initial phase, the GI will focus on acquiring buildings and developing new properties to provide housing for its members. These living spaces will also serve as operational hubs where members contribute to essential activities, such as food production, healthcare services, education, and community management. Early members will be integral to these day-to-day operations, ensuring the smooth functioning of the community and helping achieve the GI's short- and long-term goals.

As the community stabilizes and expands, the GI will acquire additional land and resources to support growth. This expansion will include the construction of new facilities, such as advanced manufacturing centers, agricultural sites, and other essential infrastructure. Members will also be engaged in the development of innovative technologies, particularly those that enhance sustainability, energy efficiency, and productivity.

Member feedback will play a key role in driving continuous improvements. As challenges and opportunities arise, the GI will rely on insights and experiences from its members to adjust and refine its approach, fostering a culture of active participation and shared responsibility.

These first communities will not only meet the immediate needs of their members but will also serve as blueprints for the future. As these initial models prove successful, the GI’s principles and infrastructure will be scaled globally, establishing a network of thriving, self-sustaining communities committed to collaboration, innovation, and human well-being.


### Step Four: World Amazing
As the GI framework takes root and expands, the vision is to transform not just individual communities but the entire world. The ultimate goal is to replicate the success of the initial community globally, creating a network of interconnected communities that embody the principles of the Global Institution. This global network will promote a shared culture of peace, innovation, and prosperity, making the world not just livable, but truly amazing for all.

## Addressing the Elephant in the Room: Deception
Many might look upon this plan and think, "This is utopian, an idealistic fantasy. It won't work because people inherently lie, cheat, and steal." Such skepticism is understandable; after all, much of recorded human history is riddled with conflicts born from hierarchical systems that encourage competition over collaboration.

The emergence of hierarchical structures some 10,000 years ago marked a significant shift in human society. Originally, for hundreds of thousands of years, humans lived in relatively egalitarian groups where cooperation was crucial for survival. However, as societies grew and became more complex, and as domestication of plants and animals also emerged, hierarchies developed, and with them, behaviors that exploited these new structures for personal gain. It is crucial to recognize that these behaviors are not inherent to our species; rather, they are bugs—malfunctions of a system that has misaligned with our biological roots.

So while the ideas presented may appear overly optimistic to some, it is important to challenge the notion that current societal dysfunctions are too ingrained to overcome. Critics might argue that the propensity for deceit and manipulation is deeply rooted in human nature, an advantage for survival. However, extensive anthropological research suggests that our ancestors thrived in cooperative clusters long before competitive hierarchies took hold. Our long-term success is largely attributed to our ability to work together, seen in our capacities for empathy, communication, and mutual support.

The resurgence of cooperative models in various modern initiatives provides contemporary evidence that collaboration is not only feasible but often more effective than competitive frameworks. Furthermore, the misunderstanding that humans are primarily competitive overlooks the flexibility of human behavior, which is highly adaptable to the structures and incentives that society constructs. By designing systems that reward and facilitate cooperation, such as the framework proposed here, we can cultivate environments that bring out the most constructive and harmonious aspects of human nature.

And so, the changes to humanity proposed in this document are not merely aspirational but grounded in an understanding of our innate tendencies. By fostering environments that prioritize cooperation and mutual support, we can transform our societies from competitive battlegrounds into cooperative havens. This shift is not only possible but necessary for the long-term sustainability and well-being of our global community. By restructuring our societal frameworks to eliminate unnecessary competition and promote mutual support, we can address the root causes of many, if not all, antisocial behaviors.



## On Those You May Currently Hate, Despise, or View Negatively
It is understandable to harbor feelings of disdain or even hatred towards individuals or groups who have caused harm or supported oppressive systems. These feelings, deeply personal and often justified, reflect broader societal issues that promote division. At times, such emotions may not stem from direct injustices but from a need to channel unresolved past fears or traumas into anger towards a group—a pattern that can be traced back through countless historical conflicts and wars. Recognizing the dynamics of hatred, and thus fear, necessitates a profound shift—not toward forced reconciliation or forgiveness for past wrongs, but toward a deep, mutual understanding that is essential for effective community interaction.

It is undeniable that shifting from entrenched animosities to a mindset of collective flourishing will be a significant hurdle for many. Throughout history, certain groups have been marginalized, demonized, or dehumanized, leading to deep-seated divisions that have persisted across generations. For some, the thought of collaborating or coexisting peacefully with those they have been taught to see as fundamentally different or even inferior—whom they may have even regarded as less than human—presents a profound challenge.

This transition, however, is essential. It requires a radical rethinking of our historical narratives and societal roles. The journey involves recognizing that these divisive views were constructed and can be deconstructed. It’s about seeing the potential for change and growth in every individual, regardless of past perceptions or conflicts. This isn’t merely an idealistic aspiration but a necessary evolution towards a society that truly values every human life as equal and integral to the collective wellbeing.

Every individual has the potential to flourish and contribute positively, even those deemed least likely. This shift is not about erasing past grievances but about understanding our collective past as a species and understanding that no one human chose the environment, either constructive or destructive, that they grew up in. Thus, the behaviors that fuel our resentments are not inherent flaws but the result of societal structures developed over millennia, which can be restructured.

Human behavior is profoundly influenced by its environment, a principle well-documented in psychological research. Behaviors that we may view as 'destructive' or 'antisocial' often stem from adaptive strategies in response to competitive environments. Environments emphasizing competition over collaboration can lead to a range of antisocial behaviors from deceit to aggression. These behaviors are not fixed traits but responses that can change when the environment encourages cooperation, empathy, and mutual support.

The path forward is through collective understanding of our situation as a species. By eliminating unnecessary competition and fostering mutual support, the root causes of many antisocial behaviors can be addressed, paving the way for a society where everyone can engage in and contribute to a harmonious future. This transformation is about redefining how individuals view each other and themselves within the complex tapestry of human history.

By understanding that our shared humanity is far more powerful than the artificial divides we have erected, we can begin to dismantle the barriers that have hindered our collective progress. This understanding does not diminish the reality of past injustices but instead channels our collective energies towards building a future where such divisions are obsolete.



## Closing Remarks
This plan transcends the arbitrary borders that have long divided humanity, embracing the common values that unite us on this singular, shared planet, dispensing national boundaries to envelop every corner of the globe, championing a world that regards each individual equally, without preference or prejudice. This land, which birthed us all, knows no borders in its care and does not favor one child over another. Together, we can craft a world where all individuals can roam every inch of this planet and look up to see not a foreign sky, but a familiar home.

This document is more than just a proposal—it is an urgent call to embrace our shared humanity, to build bridges across continents and cultures, and to establish a global network of cooperation and understanding. The Global Institution framework represents an opportunity for all of humanity to unite in crafting a durable, peaceful world that cherishes every individual equally.

Together, we can seize this opportunity to ensure that our collective efforts today lay the foundation for a harmonious humanity, for us and for future generations, forever and beyond.

- [**Crazy New Ideas**](https://paulgraham.com/newideas.html) by Paul Graham: This essay makes a case for giving serious consideration to ideas that might initially appear radical. It advocates for a thoughtful evaluation of concepts that seem implausible, like retiring by age 50 and transitioning to a two-day workweek. These ideas, while seemingly radical, are increasingly feasible given today's technological and social advances. This essay encourages us to ponder whether the truly 'crazy' notion is continuing to accept less efficient, traditional work structures when a brighter, more equitable world is within our grasp.
