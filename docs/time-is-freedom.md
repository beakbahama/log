# A Public Letter to Joe and Kamala
 
**To:** The Office of Joe and Kamala  
**Subject:** Proposal for Collaboration with the Global Institution to Enhance the "Time Is Money" Initiative  
**Date:** August 16, 2024

Dear Fellow Humans of Humanity Joe and Kamala,

I write to you today on behalf of the Global Institution (GI), an initiative dedicated to transforming societal norms to significantly enhance the quality of life and well-being of all individuals. As the Joe-Kamala administration launches the admirable "Time Is Money" campaign, we see a profound alignment with the GI’s foundational goals and principles.

**Introduction to the Global Institution (GI):**  
The Global Institution embodies a collective aspiration to cultivate a world where prosperity is not merely a possibility but a guarantee. Our vision ensures that meeting all basic needs—from housing and healthcare to education and creative fulfillment—is achieved through unified efforts. By redefining 'work' as a meaningful contribution limited to just two days a week, we not only optimize time but elevate the quality of life, allowing every individual to pursue passions that enrich both themselves and the wider community.

**Alignment with the "Time Is Money" Initiative:**  
The "Time Is Money" initiative’s focus on reducing unnecessary corporate-induced hassles directly parallels the GI’s mission to streamline life’s complexities. By reducing the workweek and setting an early retirement age of 50, we offer a tangible solution to the very problem of time theft you are addressing—freeing up countless hours for personal growth, family, and civic engagement. Our approach maximizes efficiency through a new economic model that champions community empowerment, individual well-being, and personal freedom, ensuring that each individual can lead a life rich in purpose and free from unnecessary burdens.

**Specific Proposals for Collaboration:**  
1. **Two-Day Workweek and Early Retirement:** Implementing these GI principles would serve as a pilot to demonstrate their potential to transform American work culture, significantly reducing stress and increasing personal and community engagement. The early retirement age of 50 is designed not just to optimize the well-being of our citizens but also to redefine what retirement means. Instead of stepping away from active life, retirees are encouraged to transition into roles of mentorship and guidance, becoming wise elders who focus on passing down their knowledge and skills to future generations. This shift ensures that retirement becomes a new phase of active, meaningful engagement, where the experienced members of our society continue to contribute their wisdom to communal and family life, thus maintaining economic productivity through streamlined work processes and enriched community interactions.
2. **Comprehensive Healthcare and Education:** By revolutionizing access to these essential services, we align directly with your goals of reducing hassles in everyday American life. Our integrated approach ensures that every individual is supported from childhood through retirement, with a focus on lifelong learning and proactive healthcare that adapts to individual needs over time.
3. **Global Standards, Local Implementation:** Our model adopts global standards in healthcare and education while respecting local customs and needs, ensuring that services are not only high quality but also culturally sensitive and locally relevant. This approach allows for the seamless integration of international best practices with community-specific values and traditions.

**Call to Joint Action:**  
A partnership between the U.S. government and the Global Institution could serve as a beacon of innovation in governance and societal well-being. We propose initiating joint pilot projects in select communities to test these principles and gather data on their impacts.

**Invitation for Discussion:**  
We extend an invitation to your offices to discuss these proposals further. We are eager to explore how we can integrate our visions and work collaboratively on this path-breaking journey. The potential for this partnership to create a lasting impact on American society and beyond is immense, and we are committed to supporting every step of this transformative endeavor.

**Time is Freedom:**  
In the spirit of the foundational truths upon which this nation was built, we hold that all humans are born free. Yet, true freedom is not merely the absence of physical restraints but the presence of opportunities to live a fulfilled and joyful life. The incessant demands of modern work and the stress they entail can be as constricting as any chain. The "Time Is Money" initiative acknowledges these invisible bonds by seeking to eliminate unnecessary corporate-induced hassles. Similarly, the GI proposes to liberate our citizens even further from the burden of constant work.

Our nation’s commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness must evolve to address the modern challenges we face. By implementing a two-day workweek and ensuring early retirement by the age of 50, we are not merely suggesting a reduction in hours; we are advocating for a transformation in the very essence of what it means to be free. This proposal allows every individual to reclaim time—not just to rest, but to engage deeply with their passions, their communities, and their families, crafting lives that are not just productive, but genuinely fulfilling.

Let us embrace this opportunity to become truly free—free to innovate, to create, and to build a society that reflects the highest aspirations of every person who calls this planet home. A society where liberty is not just a principle inscribed in documents, but a reality lived daily by everyone.

**Global Vision and Conclusion:**  
This plan does not recognize the arbitrary borders that divide us but rather acknowledges the common ground that unites us. Our vision extends beyond the soils of the United States to encompass every corner of the Earth—our collective home. This land, which birthed us all, knows no borders in its care and does not favor one child over another. In our efforts, we strive not only for a United States of Middle North America but for a united world, where all borders are bridged, connecting all peoples under one shared sky.

With Joe and Kamala championing this cause, we reach out to not just our fellow Americans but to every global citizen, sharing the universal necessities of life and time—essentials that should never be luxuries confined by geography. We envision a future where our lonely planet, with its solitary moon, becomes a beacon of unity and peace—an interconnected community where every individual, regardless of their birthplace, can thrive equally.

This is not merely a proposal but a call to embrace our global humanity, to forge bonds that span continents and cultures, ensuring that one day, all individuals can look up and see not a foreign sky but a familiar home. The Global Institution stands ready to lead this charge, ensuring that our collective efforts today lay the foundation for a harmonious world, forever and beyond.

Your fellow human of humanity,
