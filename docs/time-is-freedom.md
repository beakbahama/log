## On the Path Forward
Over the past several years, I've embarked on an unexpected and profound period of introspection and exploration, initially driven by a personal need for solitude. This reflection was not intended to produce a proposal to solve humanity's problems, but rather to understand myself in deeper, clearer ways. However, as I delved further into the complexities of my experiences and thoughts, it became evident that the challenges we face collectively are intricately tied to the individual struggles we all endure.

The understanding I've gained during this time, which I will share more personally at a later time, has not only been enlightening but has revealed a tangible pathway toward an incredible future for all. A future where everyone prospers, free from conflict and harm, and where every individual lives in extreme comfort and safety.

In this future, every hand is held through genuine and robust support systems integrated into the fabric of daily life. Every heart loved through community structures that ensure no one is isolated or overlooked. Every thought nurtured with educational systems designed to foster critical thinking and creativity from the earliest ages. And every word spoken is heard, valued, and integrated, creating a society where communication and deep understanding form the backbone of our collective decision-making, reflecting our new, incredible, interconnected, community based, and family-strong global civilization.

The concept of luxury will become outdated because the basics of everyday human living will encompass what was once considered a luxury for a select few: economic stability, a high level of housing, minimal work, and no worry of ever paying for a bill or a vacation ever again. This is not a distant utopia, but a real possibility grounded in the capabilities and resources we already possess today.

Housing will not merely be about providing shelter but about crafting spaces where individuals and families can thrive. Homes where even the smallest apartment is a haven of comfort and functionality, equipped with amenities that enrich daily living. In this society, the outdated notion of a middle class dissolves as everyone accesses a quality of life that includes the best of what we can achieve.

The idea of labor itself needs a complete reevaluation. Do most people really need to work 40+ hours a week? The pandemic revealed just how much of the working world is redundant and unnecessary. With current capabilities, we can recalibrate the global workweek to prioritize personal growth and community involvement over exhaustive labor. We have the resources to create an incredible society while limiting intensive work to an average of just two days a week. Further, by fostering early retirement into mentorship roles by age 50, individuals will have the freedom to invest their time in passions, relationships, and civic duties. These fundamental shifts will enhance both the quality of life and societal health for everyone.

And so, as my solitude turned into a broader social awareness, it became clear that the path to an improved future was not just a series of steps to be taken but a shift in understanding what is fundamentally possible. We have never been closer to achieving a society where suffering is not an inevitable part of the human condition but a relic of past systems and attitudes.

To all who have felt the weight of the world's challenges: we hold the power to reshape our reality into one of universal support, respect, and prosperity. Together, we can liberate individuals to pursue lives filled with learning, creativity, and personal fulfillment.



## Introducing: The Global Institution Framework
The GI framework is designed to ensure that prosperity is accessible to everyone, transforming it from a mere possibility to a guarantee. It is centered on the goal that all basic and essential human needs—including housing, healthcare, education, and creative fulfillment—are universally accessible and serve as the foundation of a thriving society. The framework replaces traditional governmental structures and NGOs with a unified system where essential services are centralized through collective efforts and advanced technologies. This approach sets to make taxation for common human essentials obsolete, shifting towards a system where community contributions directly fund societal needs.

The framework fosters a culture of creativity and innovation, empowering individuals across all societal segments to explore and develop their creative potential in an environment that nurtures innovation and artistic expression. Inclusivity is a cornerstone of this framework, ensuring that everyone, including those with troubled pasts or those currently incarcerated, as well as individuals from all backgrounds and abilities, is actively included and valued.

This framework is not just a presentation of ideas but an invitation to engage with a movement poised to redefine liberty in our time. It challenges each of us to reconsider what freedom truly means. True freedom is not merely the absence of physical restraints but the presence of opportunities to live a fulfilled and joyful life. The incessant demands of modern work and the stress they entail can be as constricting as any chain. By advocating for a two-day workweek and ensuring early retirement, the GI framework not just proposes a reduction in hours but a fundamental transformation in the very essence of freedom. This change would allow every individual to reclaim time to engage deeply with their passions, communities, and families, crafting lives that are not just productive but genuinely fulfilling.

The GI framework is designed to envelop the entire planet, serving as a universal system into which every human can integrate. It acts as a comprehensive global social contract for modern times, aiming to ensure that everyone, everywhere can access the foundations of a dignified life. By making the GI available to all, it functions as a global wrapper that promises to diminish the inequities and disparities caused by historical and geographic accidents. This universal approach doesn't just invite participation—it requires collective engagement as a fundamental aspect of its design.

## Step One: Global Discussion
The initial phase of establishing the GI involves initiating a global discussion that transcends geographical and cultural boundaries, inviting people from all walks of life to participate. This dialogue will not only focus on the core values and objectives of the GI but also serve as a platform for connection, idea exchange, and collective inspiration.

### Platforms for Engagement
To facilitate these discussions, the plan is to host a series of interactive events both online and in person. Utilizing digital media, online forums, public conferences, and webinars ensures that every individual, regardless of their location or economic status, can engage with and contribute to shaping the GI framework.

### Dynamic and Inclusive Events
Global discussions will be more than just meetings; they will be dynamic gatherings that offer a range of activities to ensure they are enjoyable and engaging for all participants. Each discussion will be designed to be a full-day event with activities before and after the core dialogues, including:
- **Cultural Performances and Local Art Displays:** Each event will celebrate the local culture of the host city through music, dance, art, and food, enriching the experience and fostering a deeper connection among participants.
- **Virtual Reality Participation:** For those who cannot attend in person, we will provide virtual reality experiences that replicate being at the event, complete with the ability to interact in real-time.
- **Workshops and Collaborative Sessions:** Following the discussions, participants can join workshops that delve deeper into specific topics, allowing for small group interactions and the development of actionable ideas.
- **Town Hall Meetings:** Integral to each event will be a town hall segment, where participants can voice their thoughts, ask questions, and directly engage with hosts and fellow attendees in an informal and open forum. This town hall approach ensures that everyone's voice can be heard and that community feedback directly influences the ongoing development of the GI framework.

### Global Accessibility and Continuous Engagement
- **Broadcast Live with Real-Time Translation:** Events will be simulcast globally with real-time translation into multiple languages, breaking down language barriers and allowing instant worldwide participation.
- **Continuous Feedback Mechanisms:** A system for ongoing feedback will be implemented, enabling participants to submit ideas and comments before, during, and after the events through a dedicated digital platform.

### Special Initiatives
- **Youth Engagement:** Special sessions and partnerships with educational institutions worldwide will engage young people, encouraging them to bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to the table.
- **Entertainment and Networking Opportunities:** Each event will feature entertainment segments and networking opportunities to keep the atmosphere vibrant and allow for informal interactions among participants.
- **Documentary and Art Projects:** The series of discussions will be documented for a global audience and integrated into a documentary series. Additionally, a collaborative global art project will be initiated, inviting contributions from participants which will be displayed at events and potentially compiled into a traveling exhibition.
- **Accessibility and Inclusion:** All physical and virtual venues will be fully accessible, with materials available in multiple formats and sign language interpreters present to ensure everyone can participate fully.



## Step Two: Funding the Core Fund and Beyond
The GI framework is designed to mobilize significant resources by engaging approximately 10% of the global population, targeting one billion people to contribute a base membership fee of $25,000 each. This strategy would create a fund totaling $25 trillion. Annually, the institution plans to use 4% of this total fund—amounting to $1 trillion—to finance its operations and initiatives from 2025 through at least 2050. This substantial budget will be primarily allocated to acquiring land and resources, essential for building a self-sufficient infrastructure and laying the groundwork for a globally integrated community.

- **Member-Controlled Financial Contributions**: Upon joining, each member's contribution is deposited into a personal account, akin to a savings account, where control over these funds remains legally with the member. This ensures that all spending decisions require member approval, embodying a democratic and transparent process where your money is your vote, and each dollar remains under your legal control indefinitely.
- **Ethical and Strategic Use of Funds**: No part of the membership fees will be used for salaries or personal enrichment. All collected funds are dedicated to acquiring land and resources necessary for providing goods and services to all members. This approach ensures that the GI core fund operates on a non-profit basis, focusing solely on enhancing the community's collective well-being.
- **Inclusive and Equitable Participation**: The GI framework is inclusive, offering pathways to membership through meaningful work for those who cannot afford the $25,000 fee. This ensures that financial barriers do not exclude willing and valuable individuals from contributing to and benefiting from the GI's initiatives. It reinforces the institution’s commitment to inclusivity and equal opportunity for all, regardless of economic status.
- **Democratic Decision-Making and Resource Allocation**: Every member is given the opportunity to influence how funds are allocated. This democratic approach ensures that everyone, regardless of their financial contribution, has a seat at the decision-making table. Members can persuade others on the best uses of the core fund, promoting a culture of active participation and shared governance.
- **Option for Personal Salary Fund**: Members have the opportunity to grow their personal funds by engaging in or starting projects within the institution. While no member will require a salary to cover essential living costs—since these are provided by the institution—the ability to earn through contributions to institution projects ensures that members can achieve financial growth and personal development within the GI framework.

### Membership Levels Beyond the Core
The GI framework introduces a tiered membership system designed to recognize various forms of member contributions. Members can ascend to higher levels through one of three ways: direct financial contributions, revenue from successful GI projects, or recognition for exceptional non-financial contributions. Each level signifies a deeper engagement with and contribution to the GI, carrying perks and increased financial influence within the community. The specifics of the benefits associated with each tier will be developed collaboratively within the GI community, ensuring they reflect the collective values and goals of all members.

#### Membership Tiers
The proposed levels include:

- **$100,000**
- **$1 million**
- **$10 million**
- **$100 million**
- **$1 billion**
- **$10 billion**
- **$100 billion**
- **Beyond $100 billion**


### Pathways to Higher Membership Levels
Members can achieve higher tiers through one of three primary pathways:

1. **Direct Financial Contributions:** Members can achieve higher membership levels by directly investing amounts that correspond to specific tiers. For example, by investing $100,000, a member qualifies for the corresponding membership level. This investment grants them the ability to personally spend an equivalent amount—$100,000—in the GI marketplace. Due to the GI's operational efficiencies and the unique economic model, spending within the GI marketplace will offer a higher value compared to traditional markets. This means that the $100,000 spent in the GI marketplace could have the purchasing power equivalent to a significantly higher amount in a conventional market, effectively doubling or even tripling the value of their spending. Thus, their initial financial contribution not only supports the GI’s projects and initiatives but also retains substantial value for personal use within the ecosystem, preserving and likely enhancing their purchasing power.

2. **Revenue from GI Projects:** Members can achieve higher membership levels by leading or significantly contributing to projects that generate revenue within the GI. For instance, to reach the $100,000 tier, a member would need their project to generate a net profit of $200,000. This profit is then divided equally, with $100,000 going into the member's GI project fund, which they directly control and can use to fund future projects or initiatives. The other $100,000 is credited to their personal salary fund, available for use within the GI marketplace or for personal saving. This structure rewards members for successful project outcomes and enhances their financial influence within the GI.

3. **Recognition for Outstanding Contributions:** Members who make significant non-financial contributions—such as exceptional community service, innovation, or leadership—can be elevated to higher membership levels in recognition of their efforts. For instance, if a member's contributions are deemed extraordinary enough to warrant elevation to the $100,000 level, they will be awarded $100,000 for their personal project fund and an additional $100,000 in their salary fund. This acknowledgment ensures that invaluable contributions of skills, expertise, and leadership are rewarded equivalently to financial investments or project revenue, empowering these members to have a greater impact within the GI while enjoying enhanced benefits in the GI marketplace.

### Benefits of Higher Levels
- **Enhanced Economic Impact**: The influx of funds from these higher tiers significantly expands the GI's financial capabilities, enabling a broader range of ambitious projects and infrastructure developments. This additional capital ensures that the GI can pursue large-scale endeavors that might be beyond the scope of the initial core fund, from advanced technological research to expansive ecological restoration projects.
- **Strategic Goal: Transition to GI Economy**: The ultimate objective of introducing these tiers is to encourage the transition of personal, corporate, and institutional funds from traditional economies into the GI economy. By offering superior value and impact per dollar spent within the GI marketplace, the framework aims to render traditional economic systems obsolete. This shift not only consolidates the GI's economic base but also aligns global financial resources with sustainable and equitable growth, making the GI a central hub for future economic activity worldwide.
- **Broadening the GI's Impact**: With these additional resources, the GI can extend its influence and capabilities, funding a wide array of projects that can have transformative effects on both local and global scales. This not only furthers the GI's mission but also attracts further investments and projects, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and innovation.

### Empowering Economic Engagement: Removing Barriers to Wealth
In the Global Institution, the concept of wealth is reimagined to remove barriers traditionally associated with financial success. Members are encouraged to use their additional free time—afforded by the GI’s two-day workweek—to engage in or initiate projects within the institution. This flexibility allows members to contribute to existing projects or start new ones that align with the GI’s principles and their personal interests. While these endeavors are not primarily driven by profit motives, they could potentially generate revenue. This not only supports the institution's initiatives but also enhances the economic well-being of its members, fostering a dynamic environment where creativity and enterprise thrive.

The GI framework envisions a community where having substantial financial resources is not seen as a problem but as an opportunity to drive communal and global improvement. By encouraging all members to potentially accumulate significant financial resources, the GI aims to dismantle the old paradigms of economic exclusivity. This strategy ensures that every member has the chance to achieve financial success without the traditional barriers, contributing both to personal prosperity and the collective good. The institution's framework is designed to ensure that profits are used ethically, supporting sustainable projects that align with the GI’s core values of inclusivity, sustainability, and community development.

Every contribution within the GI, whether through direct financial investments, project-based earnings, or recognized non-financial efforts, serves a dual purpose. Not only does it enhance the member's position and experience within our community, but it also directly contributes to the broader vision of eradicating economic barriers and fostering a sustainable and equitable world. As members invest in the GI, they're investing in a future where economic systems are not just fairer but also purposefully aligned with global well-being. This ensures that their actions, both large and small, are integral to the collective journey towards a world where freedom and prosperity are accessible to all, demonstrating the power of a united effort in making substantial, lasting changes.



## Step Three: Implementation Phases
The implementation of the Global Institution will be carried out in distinct phases to ensure efficiency and adaptability. The initial phase focuses on establishing a solid foundation by acquiring properties to house members. These early members will play a crucial role in setting up and maintaining the infrastructure necessary for a self-sustaining community.

### Initial Infrastructure and Member Housing
In the initial phase, the GI will prioritize acquiring buildings and developing properties to provide housing for its members. These accommodations will not only serve as living spaces but also as operational hubs where members can engage in various productive activities. The housed members will be integral to the institution's operations, contributing to food production, healthcare provision, and the overall maintenance of GI properties.

### Development of Community Services
Members will be involved in establishing essential community services, including but not limited to:
- **Food Production:** Implementing sustainable agricultural practices to ensure a steady supply of food for all members.
- **Healthcare Services:** Setting up comprehensive healthcare facilities staffed by GI members trained in various medical disciplines to provide free healthcare services to all members.
- **Educational Programs:** Developing educational programs and facilities to cater to the learning needs of all age groups within the community, emphasizing the GI’s commitment to lifelong learning and personal development.

### Sustainable Expansion
As the community stabilizes and grows, the GI will expand its reach by acquiring more land and resources to accommodate an increasing number of members. This expansion will be guided by the principles of sustainability and minimal environmental impact, ensuring that growth does not compromise the ecological balance.

### Integration of Advanced Technologies
To enhance efficiency and productivity within the community, the GI will integrate advanced technologies in various sectors:
- **Automated Systems** for food production and distribution to reduce labor needs and increase efficiency.
- **Health Technology Innovations**, such as telemedicine and AI diagnostics, to enhance healthcare delivery.
- **Educational Technologies**, including virtual reality and AI tutors, to provide immersive and personalized learning experiences.

### Continuous Improvement and Adaptation
The implementation phases will be subject to ongoing evaluation and adaptation to respond effectively to new challenges and opportunities. Feedback from members will be crucial in refining operational strategies and making necessary adjustments to the GI’s approach.

By strategically implementing these phases, the GI aims to create a model community that exemplifies efficiency, sustainability, and inclusivity. This community will not only serve the needs of its members but also act as a blueprint for expanding the GI's principles globally.



## Step Four: World Amazing
As the GI framework takes root and expands, the vision is to transform not just individual communities but the entire world. The ultimate goal is to replicate the success of the initial community globally, creating a network of interconnected communities that embody the principles of the Global Institution. This global network will promote a shared culture of peace, innovation, and prosperity, making the world a truly amazing place for all.



## Addressing the Elephant in the Room: Deception
Many might look upon this manifesto and think, "This is utopian, an idealistic fantasy. It won't work because people inherently lie, cheat, and steal." Such skepticism is understandable; after all, much of recorded human history is riddled with conflicts born from hierarchical systems that encourage competition over collaboration.

The emergence of hierarchical structures some 10,000 years ago marked a significant shift in human society. Originally, for hundreds of thousands of years, humans lived in relatively egalitarian groups where cooperation was crucial for survival. However, as societies grew and became more complex, and as domestication of plants and animals also emerged, hierarchies developed, and with them, behaviors that exploited these new structures for personal gain. It is crucial to recognize that these behaviors are not inherent to our species; rather, they are bugs—malfunctions of a system that has misaligned with our biological roots.

So while the ideas presented may appear overly optimistic to some, it is important to challenge the notion that current societal dysfunctions are too ingrained to overcome. Critics might argue that the propensity for deceit and manipulation is deeply rooted in human nature, an advantage for survival. However, extensive anthropological research suggests that our ancestors thrived in cooperative clusters long before competitive hierarchies took hold. Our long-term success is largely attributed to our ability to work together, seen in our capacities for empathy, communication, and mutual support.

The resurgence of cooperative models in various modern initiatives provides contemporary evidence that collaboration is not only feasible but often more effective than competitive frameworks. Furthermore, the misunderstanding that humans are primarily competitive overlooks the flexibility of human behavior, which is highly adaptable to the structures and incentives that society constructs. By designing systems that reward and facilitate cooperation, such as the framework proposed here, we can cultivate environments that bring out the most constructive and harmonious aspects of human nature.

Further, humans are biologically wired for cooperation. Interestingly, and quite shockingly, a certain unique human feature, the chin, as detailed [here](/docs/chins.md), plays a vital role in promoting cooperation, serving as a biofeedback mechanism that fosters group harmony. You may recall from childhood that the chin provides sensations to avoid conflict and reinforce cooperative behavior, though it’s possible you may not have noticed or taken note of this sensation.

And so, the changes to humanity of this manifesto are not merely aspirational but are grounded in a deep understanding of human psychology, physiology, and social dynamics. By fostering environments that prioritize our innate tendencies, we can transform our societies from competitive battlegrounds into cooperative havens. This shift is not only possible but necessary for the long-term sustainability and well-being of our global community. This manifesto proposes not just a societal reformation but a reclamation of our natural state and use of our chins. And by restructuring our societal frameworks to eliminate unnecessary competition and promote mutual support, we can address the root causes of many, if not all, antisocial behaviors. 



## On Those You May Currently Hate, Despise, or View Negatively
It is understandable to harbor feelings of disdain or even hatred towards individuals or groups who have caused harm or supported oppressive systems. These feelings, deeply personal and often justified, reflect broader societal issues that promote division. At times, such emotions may not stem from direct injustices but from a need to channel unresolved past fears or traumas into anger towards a group—a pattern that can be traced back through countless historical conflicts and wars. Recognizing the dynamics of hatred, and thus fear, necessitates a profound shift—not toward forced reconciliation or forgiveness for past wrongs, but toward a deep, mutual understanding that is essential for effective community interaction.

It is undeniable that shifting from entrenched animosities to a mindset of collective flourishing will be a significant hurdle for many. Throughout history, certain groups have been marginalized, demonized, or dehumanized, leading to deep-seated divisions that have persisted across generations. For some, the thought of collaborating or coexisting peacefully with those they have been taught to see as fundamentally different or even inferior—whom they may have even regarded as less than human—presents a profound challenge.

This transition, however, is essential. It requires a radical rethinking of our historical narratives and societal roles. The journey involves recognizing that these divisive views were constructed and can be deconstructed. It’s about seeing the potential for change and growth in every individual, regardless of past perceptions or conflicts. This isn’t merely an idealistic aspiration but a necessary evolution towards a society that truly values every human life as equal and integral to the collective wellbeing.

Every individual has the potential to flourish and contribute positively, even those deemed least likely. This shift is not about erasing past grievances but about understanding our collective past as a species and understanding that no one human chose the environment, either constructive or destructive, that they grew up in. Thus, the behaviors that fuel our resentments are not inherent flaws but the result of societal structures developed over millennia, which can be restructured.

Human behavior is profoundly influenced by its environment, a principle well-documented in psychological research. Behaviors that we may view as 'destructive' or 'antisocial' often stem from adaptive strategies in response to competitive environments. Environments emphasizing competition over collaboration can lead to a range of antisocial behaviors from deceit to aggression. These behaviors are not fixed traits but responses that can change when the environment encourages cooperation, empathy, and mutual support.

The path forward is through collective understanding of our situation as a species. By eliminating unnecessary competition and fostering mutual support, the root causes of many antisocial behaviors can be addressed, paving the way for a society where everyone can engage in and contribute to a harmonious future. This transformation is about redefining how individuals view each other and themselves within the complex tapestry of human history.

By understanding that our shared humanity is far more powerful than the artificial divides we have erected, we can begin to dismantle the barriers that have hindered our collective progress. This understanding does not diminish the reality of past injustices but instead channels our collective energies towards building a future where such divisions are obsolete.



## Closing Remarks
This plan transcends the arbitrary borders that have long divided humanity, embracing the common values that unite us on this singular, shared planet, dispensing national boundaries to envelop every corner of the globe, championing a world that regards each individual equally, without preference or prejudice. This land, which birthed us all, knows no borders in its care and does not favor one child over another. Together, we can craft a world where all individuals can roam every inch of this planet and look up to see not a foreign sky, but a familiar home.

This document is more than just a proposal—it is an urgent call to embrace our shared humanity, to build bridges across continents and cultures, and to establish a global network of cooperation and understanding. The Global Institution framework represents an opportunity for all of humanity to unite in crafting a durable, peaceful world that cherishes every individual equally.

Together, we can seize this opportunity to ensure that our collective efforts today lay the foundation for a harmonious humanity, for us and for future generations, forever and beyond.

- [**Crazy New Ideas**](https://paulgraham.com/newideas.html) by Paul Graham: This essay makes a compelling case for giving serious consideration to ideas that might initially appear radical. It advocates for a thoughtful evaluation of concepts that seem implausible, resonating especially with proposals like retiring by age 50 and transitioning to a two-day workweek. These ideas, while seemingly radical, are increasingly feasible given today's technological and social advances. This essay encourages us to ponder whether the truly 'crazy' notion is continuing to accept less efficient, traditional work structures when a brighter, more equitable world is within our grasp.
