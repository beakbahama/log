# World Amazing: A Very Practical, Measured, and Doable Plan to Make Life Amazing for All

## **Luxury Class Only Beyond This Point: No More Middle-Class**
If you’re wondering whether your life will be upgraded in the World Amazing plan, the answer is simple: for most, yes. And for those already living in luxury, your life will improve too, even if it’s less about material upgrades. The real luxury isn’t just about fancy toilets or expensive stuff. It’s about the experience of living alongside humans who are a *pleasure* to be around. Imagine a world where the stress, competition, and mistrust that plague us today are gone, replaced by joy, harmony, and trust.

Sure, we’ll all have luxurious homes with state-of-the-art features. We’ll all travel luxuriously at least yearly, eat delicious and nutritious foods, have the very best health coverage possible, and, more importantly, be so healthy that we rarely even need medical care in the first place.

And work? Forget working endlessly just to survive. Even the wealthiest among us know that working too much isn’t healthy. The true luxury is in minimizing the need to work while still ensuring a thriving, purposeful life. You can choose to work every day if that’s what fulfills you, but no one will *need* to work beyond a minimal amount. The less we *need* to work, the more time we reclaim for creativity, relationships, and joy.

This isn’t just an upgrade for individuals.

It’s a collective transformation.

Imagine a world where every human, regardless of background or circumstances, has access to the same baseline of incredible living, and the concept of a "middle-class" is a thing of the past. Everyone belongs to the luxury class because luxury becomes the standard.

It’s not just about material comforts.

It’s about a better way of living for everyone.


## **My Proposal?**
We start something new, together.  

A business.  

A community.  

A system that takes care of everything: our needs, our well-being, and our future.  

Think of it as a unifying wrapper around the entire planet, ensuring that all essentials are handled *better* and *more efficiently* than any government, company, or organization ever could.  

Because, really, what’s a government if not a business? Its "profits" come from your hard work, except they call it taxes.  

To you, it’s a tax. To them, it’s income.  

Governments do handle everything from defense to healthcare, housing, research, public spaces, and beyond. But here’s the truth: if we came together, we could do it all so much better.  

We don’t need to settle for systems that barely work.  

We can build something extraordinary and amazing, together.  

Worldwide.  

For all.  

Borders would fade into history, as the whole planet becomes an incredible place where everyone can live, thrive, and belong.


## **Deception**
But for this vision to become reality, there’s one thing we must address first: the deception that holds us back from truly working together.  

We, as a society, need to end deception.

Worldwide.

In one go.

In one conversation.  

Once we end deception, an amazing world for all will seemingly emerge on its own. We already have everything we need to make it happen: the resources, the knowledge, and the technology. There’s no reason we can’t create a luxurious way of living for every human, except for deception.  

Deception is the barrier. It feeds mistrust, competition, and inequality. It thrives in systems built on scarcity and hierarchy, and it must be addressed *immediately* to end all needless suffering.  

The real issue isn’t the climate, or abortion, or war, or anything else we debate endlessly. Those are symptoms. The real issue is deception.  

Once we replace deception with trust, transparency, and cooperation, the world will be ours to shape. An oyster waiting to reveal its pearl. A world of incredible possibility. For all. Forever and beyond.


## **From Vision to Reality: The World Amazing Plan**  
We have the vision: a luxurious, harmonious world for everyone. We know the obstacle: deception, the root of mistrust and inequality. Now, let us explore the solution, a practical framework that will transform this vision into reality.  

The **Global Institution (GI)** is the heart of the World Amazing Plan. It is more than a concept. It is a tangible, locally run institution with global ramifications. By addressing the root causes of suffering: deception, inequality, scarcity, and competition, the GI creates systems built on **transparency, empathy, and shared prosperity.**  

At its core, the GI empowers communities to take control of their own futures while contributing to a unified global effort. It is not about centralized control, but about local empowerment. It is about integrating local autonomy with global collaboration, ensuring that humanity’s collective potential is unlocked. With the GI, we can pave the way for a world where peace, joy, and fulfillment are not just aspirations, but the norm.

### **Core Principles**
1. **Universal Access to Essentials**: Incredible and luxurious housing, the best healthcare, the best education, the best food, and creative fulfillment are guaranteed rights for all, not privileges for the few. These essentials form the foundation of a thriving and equitable society where everyone can flourish.  
2. **Cooperation and Transparency**: Trust and truth must replace systems of deception and manipulation. Transparency is the cornerstone of every interaction, fostering cooperation and creating a world built on mutual respect and shared goals.  
3. **Inclusivity and Rehabilitation**: Everyone has a place in the Global Institution. Regardless of background, criminal record, incarceration status, or social status, every individual is welcomed, empowered, and supported to grow and contribute. The GI prioritizes growth and healing, ensuring that every person has the opportunity to thrive and play a meaningful role in the community. No one is left behind.
4. **Global Conversation**: Humanity’s struggles, deception, inequality, and mistrust, can only be resolved through open, honest, and ongoing dialogue. This worldwide conversation ensures that every voice is heard and every perspective shapes the future.  
5. **Sustainability and Innovation**: Creativity and technological advancements must work hand in hand with environmental stewardship. The GI prioritizes sustainability to protect the planet while fostering innovation that improves lives and ensures a better future for generations to come.  
6. **Integration of Useful Businesses**: The GI welcomes and integrates businesses of all sizes, from local shops to multinational corporations, as long as they provide value to society. By working together, these enterprises can transition into the GI framework, contributing to a cooperative, sustainable economy that benefits all.
7. **Eliminating Redundancy**: Outdated systems and industries that no longer serve humanity’s collective well-being will naturally phase out. These include for-profit services such as rental housing markets, traditional banking, and insurance industries. With the GI providing equitable and universal access to essentials, systems that perpetuate inequality, financial stress, or environmental harm will become irrelevant. Instead, resources will be directed toward truly valuable, community-driven solutions.
8. **Collective Ownership of Essentials**: Essential resources like water, energy, housing, and transportation will no longer be privately owned for profit. These utilities will be managed collectively, ensuring sustainable, equitable, and affordable access for all members. By removing the profit motive, the GI fosters collaboration and stewardship, protecting vital resources for generations to come.

### **Four Critical Steps**
1. **Global Discussion**: Launch a worldwide conversation to confront deception and shape the principles of the Global Institution. This dialogue will include voices from every corner of the world, ensuring inclusivity and collective ownership of the plan. By addressing humanity’s struggles head-on, this conversation lays the foundation for unity and shared purpose.
2. **Funding**: Raise $25 trillion through voluntary contributions to establish a sustainable core fund for housing, healthcare, and other essentials. The goal is for 10 percent of the world population, approximately 1 billion people, to contribute $25,000 USD each. For those who cannot afford this amount upfront, opportunities will be available to contribute later through additional work or by earning scholarships that recognize their past contributions to society. With these funds, $1 trillion will be allocated annually for at least 25 years to support operations, with absolutely no portion used for salaries.
3. **Phased Implementation**: Build self-sustaining communities that serve as blueprints for the future. These communities will integrate advanced systems for housing, education, healthcare, and more, demonstrating how humanity can live cooperatively and sustainably. As these models succeed, the principles of the GI will expand globally, creating a network of thriving, interconnected communities.
4. **World Amazing**: Transition humanity to a future defined by peace, prosperity, and joy. In this world, stress and scarcity are replaced by fulfillment, creativity, and purpose. By building a society rooted in cooperation, trust, and shared abundance, humanity will achieve a truly amazing future for all.

### **Key Features**
- **A 2-Day Workweek**: Essential systems are streamlined and automated, minimizing the need for labor and freeing people to explore their passions, build relationships, and enjoy life. The base level of work will not be compensated with a salary, but instead with an extraordinary quality of life. This includes a luxurious home that improves the longer you work and the more impact you have, full coverage of all education and medical expenses (including ambulance and helicopter evacuation), essential utilities, delicious and nutritious food, and yearly vacations with flights included. For those who wish to go beyond the base level, additional work can grow personal funds, supporting individual needs and enabling the creation of personal projects within the GI.
- **Empowering Human Potential**: Through access to unparalleled education, abundant resources, and boundless opportunities, every individual can achieve their highest potential. The GI ensures that no talent goes untapped and no ambition is out of reach.
- **Sustainable Systems**: The GI transitions away from profit-driven industries, replacing them with community-centered and environmentally sustainable models. These systems prioritize long-term well-being for humanity and the planet over short-term gains.
- **Flexibility and Freedom**: Members have the freedom to relocate, start businesses, and pursue their dreams without financial or systemic constraints. The GI is built to remove barriers and ensure that every individual can live a life of purpose, creativity, and fulfillment.

### **Vision for the Future**
Imagine a world where:  
- **Deception fades**: Awareness and transparency replace mistrust, creating a foundation of truth and trust across humanity.  
- **Cooperation thrives**: Collaboration and unity become humanity’s natural state, transcending divisions and fostering a shared purpose.  
- **Lives are meaningful**: Every individual has the time, resources, and opportunities to pursue their passions, nurture relationships, and contribute to a better world.  
- **Root causes are addressed**: Societal issue like crime, inequality, environmental harm are resolved at their core, eliminating the need for temporary fixes or reactionary measures. Wars and all forms of violence have no place to flourish in this world, where prosperity exists for all from birth.

This vision is not about incremental progress. It is a sweeping transformation of humanity’s systems, grounded in empathy, truth, and shared prosperity. The GI redefines what is possible, ensuring that **peace, prosperity, harmony, and joy** are not just ideals, but the everyday reality for all.  

This is **World Amazing**. And it is within our reach.


## **A Call to Join the Journey**  
The World Amazing Plan, embodied by the **Global Institution (GI)**, offers a clear and practical path to a future defined by peace, prosperity, and joy for all. It is not just a vision, it is a plan that invites every person to participate in reshaping humanity's systems into something extraordinary.  

This is not a plan for some distant future. The GI is built to be actionable today. Together, we can confront deception, foster cooperation, and unlock humanity’s collective potential. With every step, every voice, and every contribution, we move closer to a world where everyone thrives.  

If you are ready to learn more and explore how we can bring this vision to life, I invite you to dive deeper into the plan. Additional details, documents, and next steps can be found at: **[The World Amazing Plan on GitHub](https://github.com/whomanatee/plan)**  

There, you will find a more in-depth [overview](https://github.com/whomanatee/plan/blob/main/docs/world-amazing.md) with a Q&A section addressing common questions, case studies that demonstrate our potential, and much more.

The name "Whomanatee" has been proposed for the GI, a playful yet profound nod to the idea of humanity as one united organism working together in harmony. While the name is open for discussion and does not preclude the use of other names for specific projects within the GI, much like how Alphabet serves as the parent to Google, the essence remains the same: a global institution that transcends divisions and brings humanity together.

This is our moment to redefine what is possible. The question is not whether we can achieve it, but whether we will choose to. Let us take this step together, toward a world that is truly amazing, for everyone, forever.
