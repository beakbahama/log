## About
> Greetings fellow human or robot reading this. Welcome to my log, a public place for me to share my ðŸ’©. You can think of it as a partial dump of what's been on my ðŸ§ .

> Questions, comments, or concerns? Electronically mail me at m@whomanatee.org.

> The main things I'm working on are understanding the true nature of existence, addressing and healing humanity's millennia of collective suffering, and fostering [world amazing](https://worldamazing.org).

> I've created an [RSS feed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beakbahama/log/refs/heads/main/feed.xml) if you want to keep up with significant updates and new posts. And if you've never used RSS or are looking for a reader, you can check out the in browser extension [Feedbro](https://nodetics.com/feedbro/), or use something standalone like [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) or [Feedly](https://feedly.com/).

> Catch me outside for a chat about anything on this log.

> Hope to holla soon!
