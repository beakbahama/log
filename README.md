## About
> Welcome. This is a place for me to publicly share my thoughts, ðŸ’©(ideas), and more.

> I encourage everyone to create their own log on GitHub like this one. It's free and you'll have a chance to learn about git, GitHub, Markdown, HTML, CSS and more. No prior software knowledge needed. You'll also grow your writing abilities. Write how you speak to people. Speak to everyone the same. Speak to yourself the same way you speak to and about others. This way you are the same, cohesive person inside and out. ***To be real or not to be.*** That is the only question. From truth and only truth emerges peace, prosperity, harmony, and joy.

> I have been raised and shaped by various cultures and peoples, though my allegiance is to the betterment of all humans and not to one particular group, nation, or cause other than the cause for truth. And in truth we find that all humans have the same intrinsic value and potential ability. All we need is the proper environment to thrive in.  

> I prefer to be called by my given callsign as it's pronounced originally, without any variations. Alternatively, you can simply call me by my first initial, M. I welcome anyone to translate my first initial into the language you're speaking at the moment, so in Spanish, for example, it would be pronounced em-Ã©.

> Questions, comments, memes, or anything else on your mind? You can either use the ***Discussions*** section of this repository or you can send a personal email to *m@whomanatee.org*
