## Very Very Deepish Thoughts
> What do you deeply think about? Here are some things that I've deeply thought about. Create your own log on GitHub and share your deep thoughts. It's free and you'll learn about git, GitHub, markdown, HTML, CSS and more. You'll also grow your writing abilities. Write how you speak to people. Speak to everyone the same. Speak to yourself the same way you speak to and about others. This way you are the same, cohesive person inside and out. ***To be real or not to be.*** That is the only question. From truth and only truth emerges peace, prosperity, and joy

## Understanding Letters
> Love is understanding. Love grows you. You can only grow those you love. Only those that love you can grow from you. In these letters, I provide understanding and opportunities for growth for each of the addressed. This is the only way to truly love everyone and yourself

## About
> I have been raised and shaped by various cultures and peoples, though my allegiance is to the betterment of all humans and not to one particular group, nation, or cause other than the cause for truth. And in truth we find that all humans have the same intrinsic value and potential ability. All we need is the proper environment to thrive in.  

> I don't identify as having a race other than being a member of the human race, but even then I identify as being a living being more than being a human specifically. I am a member of the living beings including mammals, birds, fish, and plant life, too. To be more specific than calling myself a living being, I'm a member of the thinking beings which includes many entire species of animals like crows and cats, in addition to some members of humanity, too.  

> I prefer to be called my name, if you know it, as it's prounounced in the language it originates from. Or to simply call me 'M' as it's the first initial of my first name, though I spell it as M~ to indicate there are letters after it (and for other reasons). I welcome anyone to translate my first initial into the language you're speaking at the moment, so in Spanish, for example, my name would be pronounced ***em-Ã©***.
