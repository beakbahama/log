# ðŸ’© MY PERSONAL PUBLIC LOG
> Greetings fellow human or robot reading this. Welcome to my log, a public place for me to share my ðŸ’©. You can think of it as a partial dump of what's been on my mind. Everything I share is a work in progress, but everything has value in its current form.

> Questions, comments, memes, or concerns? You can email me at m@whomanatee.org. I reply back to emails based on the character of their characters, and not based on things such as: how well it's written, if everything is spelled correctly, if it's too long, too short, too many hyphens, too many ellipses, or anything like that. I value content that sparks thought, challenges ideas for progress, or simply comes from a place of sincerity. Feel free to communicate via meme, emoji, or some other hieroglyphic language. 

> The main thing I'm working on is making the [world amazing](https://worldamazing.org). And as you'll see, pretty much everything I share in some way ties back to this. And really this all ties back to simply creating the environment where all humans have the time and resources to think deeply. And from this, an amazing world will emerge organically and seemingly automatically.

> Interestingly, humans have a built-in biological tool for deep thought that ultimately helps us cooperate, which is just the thing we need to make the world amazing. I recently inadvertently figured out how to rekindle this biological tool. It's [chin](docs/chins.md) sensations.

> Do you recall any chin sensations at any point in your life, particularly in childhood? I am guessing that most never noticed chin sensations, and maybe less than 10% of people do recall ever having them. I'm curious to find out the exact numbers on chin sensations, we'll need a global survey on them, something that human members of the scientific or governing communities could help with.

> If interested in getting to know my thoughts further, have a look around, and if anything resonates with you, please feel free to share it with anyone using any method, including sending me an email with your thoughts. I hope you use the things I've shared to build, not destroy, and to help create an amazing world for all. Once humanity begins to move forward together as one, we can create a world where no one feels left behind and everyone soars to the highest of heights.

> I've created an [RSS feed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beakbahama/log/refs/heads/main/feed.xml) if you want to keep up with bigger updates only instead of watching every change to this repo. And if you've never used RSS or are looking for a reader, you can check out the in browser extension [Feedbro](https://nodetics.com/feedbro/), or use something standalone like [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) or [Feedly](https://feedly.com/).

> And if you want to see my unpublished drafts, head over to my [/docs](docs/) folder and take a look around. 

> Holla!
