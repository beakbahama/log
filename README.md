## About
> This is a public log I started to share my ðŸ’©

> I have been influenced and shaped by various cultures and peoples, though my allegiance is to the betterment of all humans and not to one particular group or cause other than the cause for truth. And in truth we find that all humans have the same intrinsic value and potential ability. All we need is the proper environment to thrive in.

> Have you shared a log publicly? If interested, you can create your own public log on GitHub like this one for free. You'll have a chance to learn about git, GitHub, Markdown, HTML, CSS and more, which are all very useful skills to have. You'll also grow your writing abilities and have a place to share your thoughts. No software development knowledge needed.
