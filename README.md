# ðŸ’© MY PUBLIC LOG
> Greetings fellow human or robot reading this. Welcome to my log, a public place for me to share my ðŸ’©. You can think of it as a dump of what's in my brain. Many posts are a work in progress, but all posts have value in their current form.

> Questions, comments, memes, or concerns? You can email me at m@whomanatee.org. I reply back to emails based on the character of their content, and not based on things such as: how well it's written, if everything is spelled correctly, if it's too long, too short, too many hyphens, too many ellipses, or anything like that. I value content that sparks thought, challenges ideas for progress, or simply comes from a place of sincerity. Feel free to communicate via meme, emoji, or some other hieroglyphic language. 

> The main thing I'm working on is making the [world amazing](https://worldamazing.org). And as you'll see, pretty much everything I write in some way ties back to this. And really this all ties back to simply creating the environment where a human has the time and resources to think deeply.

> Interestingly, humans have a built-in biological tool for deep thought that ultimately helps us cooperate, which is just the thing we need to make the world amazing. I recently inadvertently figured out how to rekindle this biological tool. It's [chin](docs/chins.md) sensations.

> Do you recall anything about this from childhood? I am guessing that most never noticed and maybe less than 10% of people recall chin usage. I'm curious to find out the exact numbers on this, we'll need a global survey on chin sensations, something that human members of the scientific or governing communities could help with.

> If interested in getting to know my thoughts further, have a look around, and if anything resonates with you, please feel free to share it with anyone using any method, including sending me an email with your thoughts. I encourage you to use the things I write to build, not destroy, and to help create an amazing world for all. Let's take a step forward together, as one humanity, to create a world where no one feels left behind and everyone soars to the highest of heights.

> If you want to see my unpublished drafts, head over to my [/docs](docs/) folder and take a look around.
