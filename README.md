# 💩 THE LOG OF M~

## DOCS
- [**The Explanation for Existence**](docs/existence.md) - *This explanation doesn’t ask you to believe anything. It starts at the beginning — the real beginning — and walks forward with no foundational gaps and no guesses. What emerges isn’t a theory, but the only structure that could exist.*

- ***COMING SOON!*** - **The Human Stress Response System** - *Beneath our awareness is a full-body feedback system designed to resolve conflict through thought. The chin, the jaw, the cheeks, the forehead, the tissue above the skull — and many other regions across the body, from head to toe — are all part of this buried and forgotten response to adversity.*

## PROJECTZ
- [**The World Amazing Plan**](https://worldamazing.org/) – *This is a real plan to reorganize the world — not by force, but by truth, cooperation, and guaranteed care for every human. It’s not a pitch. It’s a blueprint.*
