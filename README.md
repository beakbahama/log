# ðŸ’© MY PERSONAL PUBLIC LOG

## Thoughts
- [**Time is Freedom**](docs/time-is-freedom.md): We are working too much and it doesn't make sense. We can all work way less just by being efficient with our time and resources, and in this document, a manifesto for freedom, I discuss how we can get our time, and freedom, back. I'm talking working 2 days a week on average, retiring from any intense physical or mental labor by 50, and living a life focused on self, family, community, and beyond, giving everyone a chance to excel in all areas of human ability. Proceed with caution and an open mind.

- [**The Human Chin**](docs/chins.md): The only unique thing about humans are chins, not the big brain or anything else. And the reason for them: to help us think and avoid conflict. In this document, I explore the chin and my relatively recent rediscovery of its purpose. Adult me didn't figure it outâ€”kid me did.


## About
> Welcome. This is a place I started to publicly share my ðŸ’©.

> Do you have a public log? Why or why not? I encourage everyone to create their own log on GitHub like this one. It's free and you'll have a chance to learn about git, GitHub, Markdown, HTML, CSS and more. No prior software knowledge needed. You'll also grow your writing abilities. Write how you speak to people. Speak to everyone the same. Speak about yourself the same way you speak to and about others. This way you are the same, cohesive person inside and out. ***To be real or not to be.*** That is the only question. From truth and only truth emerges peace, prosperity, harmony, and joy.

> I have been raised and shaped by various cultures and peoples, though my allegiance is to the betterment of all humans and not to one particular group or cause other than the cause for truth. And in truth we find that all humans have the same intrinsic value and potential ability. All we need is the proper environment to thrive in.  

> I prefer to be called by my given callsign, Ù…Ø­Ù…Ø¯ (Mohammad), pronounced as it was originally intended, and I am thankful for all sincere attempts at pronouncing it correctly. Alternatively, if you prefer, you can simply call me by my first initial, M, and I encourage anyone to translate it into any language, so in Spanish, for example, it would be pronounced em-Ã©.
