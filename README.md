## About
> Welcome. This is a place for me to publicly share my thoughts, ðŸ’©(ideas), and more.

> I encourage everyone to create their own log on GitHub like this one. It's free and you'll have a chance to learn about git, GitHub, Markdown, HTML, CSS and more. No prior software knowledge needed. You'll also grow your writing abilities. Write how you speak to people. Speak to everyone the same. Speak to yourself the same way you speak to and about others. This way you are the same, cohesive person inside and out. ***To be real or not to be.*** That is the only question. From truth and only truth emerges peace, prosperity, harmony, and joy.

> I have been raised and shaped by various cultures and peoples, though my allegiance is to the betterment of all humans and not to one particular group, nation, or cause other than the cause for truth. And in truth we find that all humans have the same intrinsic value and potential ability. All we need is the proper environment to thrive in.  

> I prefer to be addressed by my given callsign, pronounced as it is originally intended, without variations, and I am thankful for all sincere attempts at pronouncing it correctly. Alternatively, you can simply call me by my first initial, M. I welcome anyone to translate my first initial into the language you're speaking at the moment, so in Spanish, for example, it would be pronounced em-Ã©.
